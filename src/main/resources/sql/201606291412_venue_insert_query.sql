Founded as an artist project in 2004, C4RD has since provided a public exhibition series, residencies, talks, publications and encouraged production towards independent and non-commercial aims; C4RD is in the unique position of being able to provide a whole building dedicated to drawing - showing continuous exhibitions of a broad variety of drawing practice - and also be able to house residencies specifically for those for whom drawing is a core part of their practice. This is in addition to the C4RD web presence, the C4RD Community registry, publications (D4RD and Z4RD), Special Projects, and Online Residencies.


Drawing as an approach is regaining the importance it once had as a way of thinking or acting that is fundamental to the human experience. It is being considered less as a particular use of materials or sub-activity of a particular discipline, and more as an approach discrete in itself. Drawing defined as the exercise of the imagination or mind on line reinforces drawing’s capacity as a performed analogy (mentally/manually) of the continuum that is human consciousness; two marks, as in mathematics, necessarily make a line. Drawing is essentially a connective understanding; between the eye, the hand, and the mind.


C4RD’s purpose is to make space for drawing. By maintaining the visibility of a characteristically humanist approach that is drawing - in the encouragement and refinement of the understanding of drawing, the arts and society at large can benefit. C4RD seeks to facilitate access and dialogue for current drawing practice independent of structural forces in commercial and institutional settings. 


C4RD welcomes all those with a particular interest in drawing as a core experience from within and outside the arts. It seeks a balanced programme to present a broad variety of expansive possibilities in drawing. More information on our programmes is available on this website. C4RD is entirely staffed by volunteers and is supported by the generosity of individuals and and corporate donors.','Centre For Recent Drawing',2,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'2-4 Highbury Station Road N1 1SB London',NULL,0,51.5455452,'2-4 Highbury Station Road N1 1SB London',-0.104828300000008,'Thursday - Saturday : 13:00 - 18:00',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'www.c4rd.org.uk');

 It partially stands as homage to the iconic French jewellery designer 
Suzanne Belperron. Belmacz was founded by Julia Muggenburg in 2000 to 
show her one-of-a-kind gems. Today Belmacz has evolved into a truly 
unique space in which Julia Muggenburg alongside selected artists and 
friends, explores the aesthetics of modern life, and the ways in which a
 variety of art forms, from past and present, can inform each other.
 
Opposite Claridge’s in London’s Mayfair, 
located in a two-storey Regency building on Davies Street, Belmacz is a 
modern version of the ‘Wunderkammer’. By offering clients, friends and 
visitors displays of Julia Muggenburg’s unique precious jewels, 
contemporary art, ancient artefacts and objects of virtue.
 
Through its annual programme of solo and 
group exhibitions, and the dialogues it facilitates, Belmacz is a podium
 upon which emerging and established national and international artists 
are invited to explore some of the most pressing issues of our times. In
 2014 Julia was invited to present her unique vision at Nottingham 
Contemporary, one of the largest contemporary art centres in the UK, 
where she curated the exhibition Fourth Drawer Down, a reflection on the intersection between art and anthropology, drawing on her personal collection.
 
Born in Germany and trained in fine art in 
London’s Central Saint Martins, Julia Muggenburg created her first 
jewels to fulfil her need for sensuous, architectural and iconic 
objects. Rooted in ancient craft traditions yet boldly contemporary, 
Belmacz jewels evoke a twenty-first-century take on the status-affirming
 ceremonial adornments worn by tribal chiefs, patriarchs and paragons of
 style.
 
“Empowering primeval-modern ornaments for today’s cool, intellectual, urban warrior”
Vivienne Becker (Financial Times)
 
Redefining such universal forms, as the 
ring, the cuff, or the necklace, Belmacz pieces are Julia Muggenburg’s 
form of expressing the contemporary, refined spirit. Even a 
state-of-the-art Belmacz cache of balms, glosses, powders and eye 
colours with pure 24ct gold leaf has been conceived. These enduring 
Belmacz gems are created to enhance the wearer’s sense of empowerment,

the major dealers in prints, Jacobson began to show paintings and 
sculpture. The early 1980s saw the gallery open branches in Los Angeles 
and New York, expanding the range of international artists to include 
West Coast American artists such as Joe Goode and Larry Bell as well as 
modern British masters such as David Bomberg, Ivon Hitchens, Peter 
Lanyon, Ben Nicholson, William Scott, Stanley Spencer, and Graham 
Sutherland. From 1997, the gallery moved more firmly into American and 
international art, with shows of artists such as Kenneth Noland, Jules 
Olitski, Larry Poons and Frank Stella. Recently, the gallery has held 
shows by the American artists Robert Motherwell and Helen Frankenthaler,
 Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Tom Wesselmann, while 
European painters include Bram Bogart and Pierre Soulages and British 
artists William Tillyer, Bruce McLean and Marc Vaux.

In 2004, the gallery moved to 6 Cork Street in London\'s Mayfair, 
uniting Bernard Jacobson Graphics and Bernard Jacobson Gallery under one
 roof. The gallery has held major exhibitions including a two-part 
examination of Robert Motherwell\'s Open series (which provided the 
largest showing of the artist\'s work in the UK since the 1978 
retrospective at the Royal Academy of Arts, London), a selection of 
works from Helen Frankenthaler\'s personal collection, a four-part 
exhibition of the work of British artist William Tillyer, and the first 
UK exhibition of new work by French painter Pierre Soulages, for over 
thirty years. The exhibition followed on the tail of a major Soulages 
retrospective at the Centre Georges Pompidou, and was received with huge
 success in London. The artist has since been celebrated with the 
opening of the Musee Soulages in Rodez.

More recently, the gallery has hosted major solo exhibitions of work by modern masters: Robert Motherwell (Works on Paper, October - November 2011); Ben Nicholson (Paintings, Drawings, and Reliefs, April - June 2012); Kurt Schwitters (Collages and Assemblages, February - April 2013) and Sam Francis (Works from the 1950s to 1990s, June to August 2014). Solo exhibitions by contemporary artists included: William Tillyer (The Watering Place, October to December 2013, which coincided with the artist\'s retrospective Against Nature at the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art); Korean artist Kwang Young Chun (New Works, March – April 2014); Bruce McLean (Action Sculpture Potato Painting, February – March 2014) and Marc Vaux (New Ovals, May 2014 ).

their own curators.

The Brief

The artist\'s objective is to frame an exhibition that contextualises the interests and concerns driving their practice. To share and expand upon their creative process.

Their task is to curate relevant (or contradictory) works / objects / photos / texts / music etc that have personal significance, inform and support their practice, and present them in an intriguing, cohesive exhibition.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Marlborough Fine Art was founded in 1946 by Frank Lloyd and Harry Fischer who had emigrated from Vienna to England shortly after the outbreak of war. In Vienna, Lloyd\'s family had been art and antique dealers for three generations and Fischer had dealt in antiquarian books. They were joined in 1947 by David Somerset, later Duke of Beaufort.

In 1951 the gallery initiated its programme of 19th and 20th century masters with an exhibition of the complete bronzes of Degas, followed by exhibitions of Géricault, Courbet, Cassatt, Monet, Pissarro and Sisley, Léger, Renoir, Laurens, Gris, Ensor and crowned by an exhibition of Van Gogh self-portraits in 1960. In the same year it opened a second gallery, Marlborough New London, to exhibit mainly, but not exclusively, a post-war generation of international artists such as Alberto Burri, Piero Dorazio, Juan Genovés, Richard Lin, Georges Mathieu and Arnaldo Pomodoro. These exhibitions were seen to set new standards for commercial galleries both in scope and in catalogue design. Many were recognised as museum quality exhibitions and the gallery became a focus for international collectors, museum directors and connoisseurs as well as art history students.

In the late 1950\'s and early 1960\'s Marlborough was the first gallery to introduce a London audience to exhibitions of German and Austrian painting of the 20th century. Exhibitions such as Art in Revolt - Germany 1905-1925, Kandinsky - the Road to Abstraction, The Painters of the Bauhaus, Egon Schiele, Munch and Nolde, and a major Kurt Schwitters retrospective were truly ground-breaking for London. At about the same time, the gallery started to show major contemporary artists and to promote British artists on an international scale in conjunction with the British Council. Marlborough also signed up some of the most important British artists of the time including Francis Bacon, Lynn Chadwick, Lucian Freud, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Ben Nicholson, Victor Pasmore, Graham Sutherland, as well as emerging artists such as Avigdor Arikha, Frank Auerbach, John Davies, R.B.Kitaj, Joe Tilson and others.

In the 1960\'s Frank Lloyd moved to New York to run its new gallery which opened in 1963 with a major exhibition ‘Artist and Maecenas: a Tribute to Curt Valentin’, the German émigré who had been one of the leading modern European sculpture and painting dealers in New York for almost 20 years, and who had nurtured many of the then directors of America’s most important art museums. Marlborough had opened its first gallery abroad, in Rome in 1962, followed by Zurich in 1971, Tokyo in 1983, Madrid in 1992 and Monaco in 2000. The ambition was to be able to offer its artists the possibility of exhibitions across the world, and to be able to collaborate with major museums on their exhibitions. In 1972 Frank’s son Gilbert, who had joined Marlborough Fine Art ten years earlier, assumed control of the London galleries.

These galleries continued the tradition of curating shows of modern masters as well as Marlborough’s policy, often in collaboration with the British Council, of the international promotion of their contemporary artists. In this tradition, Francis Bacon’s revelatory retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971 was followed by major museums exhibitions at The Metropolitan Museum, New York in 1975, the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, in 1983 and Bacon’s first ever showing in Russia, at the New Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, in 1988. Similarly, Marlborough assisted with Henry Moore’s touring exhibitions in Latin America in 1964, Eastern Europe in 1966, and the immense retrospective at the Forte Del Belverdere, Florence in 1972. It has a distinguished history of selling major works to some of the world’s leading art museums, such as Brancusi’s 1911 ‘Maiastra’ to the Tate Gallery, Chagall’s ‘Violinist’ of the same year to the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Kokoschka’s 1912 ‘Portrait of Alma Mahler’ to the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, Matisse’s 1925 ‘Odalisque au Pantalon Rouge’ to the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, Caracas, and Kandinsky’s 1910 ‘Improvisation 9’ to the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart.

In 1973 the gallery had organised retrospectives of the work of Jacques Lipchitz and René Magritte, Max Beckmann and Max Bill in 1974, a major exhibition of Henri Matisse in 1978 and the innovative Schwitters in Exile show of 1981 which helped to reshape opinion of the late work of this artist. From 1980 onwards the Marlborough stable of international artists continued to expand and be exhibited worldwide, the London gallery taking on a new generation of artists, including Stephen Conroy, Hughie O’Donoghue and Ken Kiff. After the restoration of democracy in Spain, Marlborough, which had already been exhibiting Antonio Lopez García and his circle for a decade, opened its gallery in the capital. Gallery representation has since been established in Barcelona and in Santiago de Chile, and Marlborough has maintained a pattern of participating in the leading art fairs round the globe; the Art Basel, Basel and Art Basel, Hong Kong, Art Basel, Miami, TEFAF Maastricht and Frieze Masters.

Furthering its innovative approach towards the international art market, in 1993 Marlborough was the first gallery in London to exhibit the new generation of post-communist Chinese artists in New Art from China; post-1989, which included artists such as Zeng Fanzhi and Zhang Xiaogang. The gallery also developed a close association with the late Chen Yifei, whom it first exhibited in 1996. More than 60 years on, the gallery continues to be associated with some of the greatest living artists of today. Frank Auerbach, Paula Rego and Manolo Valdes, for example, are seen to be among the most important living artists at the peak of their careers. In a shrinking world, Marlborough continues to promote and organise exhibitions in its galleries and beyond, to participate in art fairs and to collaborate with museums in organising exhibitions of its artists. The gallery is also expanding its activities into parts of the world like China, Brazil, Mexico and Russia, as interest in the contemporary art scene continues to grow with new museums, galleries and collectors world-wide.

This criterion is still used by the Gallery today when deciding which works enter the National Portrait Gallery\'s collection. Originally, it was decided by the Trustees that "No portrait of any person still living, or deceased less that 10 years, shall be admitted by purchase, donation, or bequest, except only in the case of the reigning Sovereign, and of his or her Consort".

The founders were two wealthy individuals Arthur Knyvett-Lee and Anthony Maxtone Graham. A young New Zealander, Rex Nan Kivell, joined the gallery in 1925 and, in 1931, took control of the company. Notable exhibitions in these early years include a 1924 mixed exhibition which included the student work of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, and in 1929, the first exhibition of British Linocuts, featuring prints by the Grosvenor School of Modern Art, particularly Sybil Andrews, Cyril Edward Power, and their instructor, Claude Flight.

In 1936 the gallery moved around the corner to larger premises at 20 Cork Street - just opposite the Burlington Arcade and behind the Royal Academy of Arts. The house which comprises 19/20 Cork Street was built in the early 18th Century. At that time it was the town house of John Montague, 4th Earl of Sandwich, and Redfern\'s main galleries are purportedly where the Earl used to play cards when he was in London. While the gallery does not have any street-facing windows, the Redfern is one of the few London galleries to benefit from skylights. In 1938, the Redfern organised the first large-scale retrospective of Christopher Wood\'s paintings at the New Burlington Galleries. Unlike many West End galleries, the Redfern was able to stay in operation during the Second World War; Eileen Agar, Corot, Eric Gill, Augustus John, Paul Nash, and Christopher Wood were just some of the artists exhibited during that period.

The 1960s saw a new generation of young British artists emerging, and the Redfern Gallery was no different. In 1963, Patrick Procktor had his first solo exhibition nearly sell-out before the opening evening; he would remain represented by the Redfern for the rest of his career. The gallery was also exhibiting young talent such as John Carter, David Hockney, Bryan Organ, David Oxtoby and Peter Sedgley.

Today the Redfern represents over 30 contemporary artists and artist\'s estates. It also has an extensive stock of modern and contemporary paintings, drawings, watercolours, sculpture and original prints.

Now situated at Victoria Park Road E9, it’s mission remains strong; to challenge convention and promote a movement of cultural progression through fine art.

The gallery exhibits a wide range of media in often immersive-installation styled exhibitions.

Through major commissions and smaller projects we work with artists and other practitioners who have not previously had significant exposure in London, often introducing international artists to London, and working in partnership with other individuals and organisations within our networks, both at home and abroad.

We also work closely with our local community through an aspect of the programme called Communal Knowledge, and have developed strong, long-term relationships with local groups and individuals who we bring together to work in partnership with artists on specific projects and commissions which feed into the programme as a whole.

Public events and workshops form part of these commissions, with a broader programme of publishing, research and events including discussions, screenings, panels, book launches and performances running alongside.

The Showroom was established in 1983 and in 2013 celebrated thirty years of supporting artists to stage their first solo shows in London and its role as a pivotal force in the development of contemporary art practice.

It was one of the first galleries in what is now a thriving East End art scene, but moved from its Bonner Road site in Bethnal Green to Penfold Street near Edgware Road in 2009. The first exhibition at Penfold Street was A Long Time Between Suns Part II, by The Otolith Group, which earned them a nomination for the Turner Prize 2010.

Other now well-known artists commissioned by The Showroom early in their careers include Marc Chaimowicz, Jim Lambie, Eva Rothschild, Mona Hatoum, Simon Starling, Rebecca Warren, Claire Barclay, Can Altay, Lawrence Abu Hamdan and Ciara Phillips (project nominated for the Turner Prize 2014).

The organisation has had four directors: Emily Pethick (2008–current), Kirsty Ogg (1998–2008), Kim Sweet (1992–1998) and David Thorp (1988–1992) and since 2009 its core staffing, while still small, has increased.

As well as supporting artists at the right moment in their careers, The Showroom has always played a role in developing discourse around contemporary art practices. This activity was expanded as a result of the move to Penfold Street and the directorship of Emily Pethick, and the organisation now programmes around 50 public events per year, almost all of which are free to access.','The Showroom',2,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'63 Penfold Street NW8 8PQ London',NULL,0,51.5237011,'63 Penfold Street NW8 8PQ London',-0.173328900000001,'Wednesday - Saturday : 12:00 - 18:00',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'www.theshowroom.org');

Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works,[4] is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence[4] and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.[a]

The British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759, in Montagu House in Bloomsbury, on the site of the current museum building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of an expanding British colonial footprint and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the British Museum (Natural History) in South Kensington in 1881. Some objects in the collection, most notably the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, are the objects of controversy and of calls for restitution to their countries of origin.

Until 1997, when the British Library (previously centred on the Round Reading Room) moved to a new site, the British Museum housed both a national museum of antiquities and the national library in the same building. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and as with all other national museums in the United Kingdom it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions.[5] Neil MacGregor became director of the museum in August 2002, succeeding Robert G. W. Anderson.[6] In April 2015, MacGregor announced that he would step-down as Director on 15 December.[7] On 29 September 2015, the Board of Trustees confirmed Hartwig Fischer, who will assume his post in Spring 2016, as his successor.[8]','British Museum',2,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'Great Russell St WC1B 3DG London',NULL,0,51.5189698,'Great Russell St WC1B 3DG London',-0.126500299999975,'Monday - Sunday : 10:00 - 17:30, Friday : 10:00 - 20:30',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'www.britishmuseum.org');

It was her wish that the house become a museum to honour her illustrious father. The Freuds were fortunate to be able to bring all their furniture and household effects to London. These included splendid Biedermeier chests, tables and cupboards, and a fine collection of 18th and 19th century Austrian painted country furniture.

Noticing that the museum was frequently filled with bored, noisy children he sought to make it more child-friendly. As part of this endeavour, he set up a classroom and employed teachers. He also began to source child-related objects, a project in which Queen Mary (the wife of King George V) joined him, donating many toys of her own. A Mrs Greg of Leeds became interested and also began to donate her collection of toys to the museum. For the duration of the Second World War and until 1950, the museum operated as a British Canteen, for feeding the general public. When it re-opened, a small collection of childhood-related objects were displayed again next to the V&A circulation department’s exhibitions.

Over the following 23 years, this area of the collection became noticeably popular. To this end, when Roy Strong became director of the V&A in 1973, he instigated changes that resulted in the Bethnal Green Museum re-opening in 1974 as the Museum of Childhood. All childhood-related collections held at the South Kensington site came to Bethnal Green and all non-childhood related objects at Bethnal Green went to South Kensington. Meanwhile, the Museum’s childhood collection continued to grow with new acquisitions from toy companies, the BBC, members of the public and government funds.The Museum is arranged into four main galleries – the Moving Toys Gallery, the Creativity Gallery, the Childhood Galleries and the Front Room Gallery.','Victoria And Albert Museum of Childhood',2,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'Cambridge Heath Road E2 9PA London',NULL,0,51.5276591,'Cambridge Heath Road E2 9PA London',-0.0548387000000048,'Monday - Sunday : 10:00 - 17:45',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'www.museumofchildhood.org.uk');

The collection embraces all media, from painting, drawing, sculpture and prints to photography, video and film, installation and performance.
Scope of the collection

Tate seeks to represent significant developments in art, in all areas within its remit, with artworks of outstanding quality and importance.

British art is represented by artists chosen for their contribution to its history and development, rather than their nationality alone.

While it has traditionally focused on art from Western Europe and North America, has recently expanded its holdings of modern and contemporary artworks from Africa, Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia.
The collection on display

The collection is on display at Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives and around the world in temporary and long term exhibitions, via loans.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Christ Church is unique among the Oxford and Cambridge colleges in possessing an important collection of Old Master paintings and drawings, housed in a purpose-built Gallery of considerable architectural interest in itself.

General John Guise bequeathed his collection of over 200 paintings and almost 2000 drawings to his former college, where it arrived after his death in 1765. This extraordinary gift enabled Christ Church to introduce art into Oxford education without the necessity to travel to Italy or to gain access to stately homes, which still held the majority of art collections in the country. At that date the collection was unequalled by any other Oxford institution. The Bodleian ‘Picture Gallery’ housed mainly portraits and the Ashmolean Museum, the oldest museum in Britain, had a large and interesting collection of artifacts and objects, but at that time included few paintings.

The collection was reinforced by the subsequent gifts by the Hon. William Fox-Strangways (37 paintings, given in 1828 and 1834), including Filippino Lippi’s ‘The Wounded Centaur’, and by the family of the poet Walter Savage Landor (26 paintings, given in 1897).

A number of subsequent gifts and bequests of paintings enabled Christ Church’s art collection to grow. Today it consists of some 300 paintings and almost 2000 drawings. The last two major donations to the Picture Gallery enriched it further with a collection of English Glass of the 18th and 19th century and a number of Russian icons of the 17th and 18th century. These treasures are now displayed and cared for in Christ Church Picture Gallery. The purpose-built gallery conceived to house the collection was designed by the architects Powell and Moya and was opened in 1968 by Her Majesty the Queen. Previously the paintings had been mainly hung in the Library.

The collection is strongest in Italian art, from the 14th to the 18th century. Most of the early Italian panel paintings came as a gift from W. H. T. Fox-Strangways and reflects his taste for 14th century Italian art, a preference which was unusual at that time. A number of these early religious panels are painted by now anonymous masters, but they allow the viewer to trace the beginnings of the professional ‘artist’ as we know him. Later works in the collection include paintings by highly acclaimed artists such as Filippino Lippi, Tintoretto, Veronese, Annibale Carracci and Salvator Rosa. Additionally, there are also some remarkable works by northern painters such as Anthony van Dyck, Frans Hals and Hugo van der Goes.

The internationally renowned drawings collection in the Picture Gallery at Christ Church is regarded as one of the most important private collections of Old Master drawings in the country and includes work by the masters; Leonardo, Michelangelo, Dürer, Raphael and Rubens. For reasons of conservation the entire drawings collection cannot be permanently on show, but a selection of drawings is always on view. These small in-house exhibitions (see menu on the left) are changed about every three months to enable the public to see a varied selection from this part of the collection.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Grizedale Arts is an arts organisation based on the historic site of Lawson Park farm, above the Coniston valley in the Lake District.

The organisation is a curatorial project in a continuous state of development. Our current site, Lawson Park, is run as a productive small holding and working farm house, with a multifaceted programme of events, projects, residencies and community activity. Central to our ethos is the aim of implementing a more valuable function for art through a unique, cross-disciplinary education programme with a range of activities - all of which function to develop contemporary art in new directions; working beyond the Romantic and Individualist frameworks that have dominated thinking of the past 200 years of art history. Underpinning this programme therefore, is a philosophy that emphasises a use value for art; promoting the potential for art and artists to experiment and affect change in practical and effective roles, as a central tenet of wider culture and society.

The Grizedale Arts programme actively engages with the complexities of the rural environment. Rather than focusing on creating a finished art product we concentrate on the process, and the dissemination of ideas to a wider audience. In doing so, we typically work alongside the local community of a project to develop and realise work with artists - consequently the projects often challenge the artists as much as the local (participatory) audience. The activities are often fed into a major annual project or event that allows public access to the Grizedale’s process; as something that introduces artists’ thinking into everyday life, situating active contemporary arts alongside the culture of the rural environment.
