Since the 8th century BC, Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Normans all settled or invaded the island, lured by its fertile lands and strategic location. Over time, this series of conquests forged a cultural identity unlike any other. This exhibition tells Sicily’s fascinating stories – from the arrival of the Greeks and their encounters with the Phoenicians and other settlers, to the extraordinary period of enlightenment under Norman rule in the 11th to 13th centuries. For much of its history, Sicily was admired and envied for its wealth, cultural patronage and architecture. In the exhibition, ancient Greek sculpture, architectural decorations from temples, churches and palaces, early coinage, stunning gold jewellery, and Norman mosaics and textiles demonstrate Sicily’s diversity, prosperity and significance over hundreds of years. Discover an island with a cosmopolitan history and identity – a place where the unique mix of peoples gave rise to an extraordinary cultural flowering.

Their story is told for the first time in this blockbuster exhibition.Vanished beneath the waters of the Mediterranean, the lost cities of Thonis-Heracleion and Canopus lay at the mouth of the Nile. Named after the Greek hero Heracles, Thonis-Heracleion was one of Egypt’s most important commercial centres for trade with the Mediterranean world and, with Canopus, was a major centre for the worship of the Egyptian gods. Their amazing discovery is transforming our understanding of the deep connections between the great ancient civilisations of Egypt and Greece. Preserved and buried under the sea for over a thousand years, the stunning objects in the exhibition range from magnificent colossal statues to intricate gold jewellery. Sacred offerings and ritual objects reveal the cult of Osiris – the god of the underworld who held the promise of eternal life.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Art, design, craft and technology are often considered as separate disciplines. However, there is a long, alternative tradition that views them in a holistic way, both as tools for learning and as part of a wider culture that values making as central to society.
This integrated understanding of creative practice manifests in various lines of thought, organisations and movements. Examples include the ‘mechanical arts’ of medieval times; the Mechanics Institutes and the Arts and Crafts of the nineteenth century; the Steiner schools, Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Pedagogy of the Oppressed in the twentieth century; and makerspaces of today. This display brings together works from the Middlesbrough Collection, with an emphasis on ceramics and contemporary jewellery. The pieces are grouped thematically, allowing connections to emerge through social use. Rotating presentations feature projects devised by local constituencies and artists who explore topical issues.
Here you can research the Middlesbrough Collection, join regular workshops, organise meetings, and lead or participate in making sessions. Middlesbrough Collection. The Middlesbrough Collection was inherited from the former Cleveland Crafts Centre, Cleveland Gallery and Middlesbrough Art Gallery. It holds approximately 2,250 works from around 1900 to the present time, with strengths in post–Second World War British and international drawing, twentieth-century British ceramics and contemporary international jewellery. One significant segment of the Middlesbrough Collection, devoted to innovative ways of understanding and practicing jewellery, was initiated at Cleveland Craft Centre in the early 1980s under the guidance of the curator Ralph Turner. Artists Otto Künzli, Emmy Van Leersum and Gijs Bakker and Wendy Ramshaw are among many who were key to the development of a new, experimental approach to jewellery from the 1960s onwards. Their works explore utility, narrative, value, material, shape and scale. The ceramics in the Middlesbrough Collection chart the evolution of the Studio Pottery movement from the early 1900s to today, focusing on British production. This section includes items by the renowned UK-based ceramicists Hans Coper, Lucie Rie and Bernard Leach as well as sculptural pieces by artists Grayson Perry and Edmund de Waal, among others.

Curated by Luc Tuymans, this exhibition will present a truly original body of work, seen through the eyes of one of today’s leading painters.Despite spending his whole professional life in the Belgian seaside town of Ostend, James Ensor was very successful in his lifetime and exerted considerable influence on the development of Expressionism. An innovator and an outsider, he rebelled against the conservative art teachings of the late 19th century academy in Brussels, drawn instead to the avant-garde salons where his radical creative vision could thrive.  Ensor’s childhood spent among the fantastical treasures of his family’s curiosity shop offers a clue as to how the seeds of this wild imagination were sown. The imagery of masks and carnivals runs through much of his work, from vibrant colours and flamboyant costumes to an ever-present sense of drama and satire.  We have invited the artist Luc Tuymans, a fellow Belgian and admirer of Ensor, to curate this unique exhibition.

This fascinating exhibition explores this pivotal period in British history, which changed the way we think about art to this day.  It gathers together artists who took art beyond its traditional boundaries to suggest new ways of engaging with the realities of the world beyond the studio, which ultimately led to a questioning of the function and social purpose of art. The radical and controversial work both scrutinised and consistently took inspiration from the real world. Asking what art is, as well as what it might be for, inevitably led some artists to create work that was often politically engaged with themes and issues ranging from feminism to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Seen within the context of its time, spanning Harold Wilson’s first Labour government to the election of Margaret Thatcher, this show reveals conceptual art’s lasting legacy.Artists featured within the show include, among others: Keith Arnatt, Art & Language, Conrad Atkinson, Victor Burgin, Michael Craig-Martin, Hamish Fulton, Margaret Harrison, Susan Hiller, John Hilliard, Mary Kelly, John Latham, Richard Long, Bruce McLean, David Tremlett and Stephen Willats.','Conceptual Art in Britain 1964–1979',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'Millbank SW1P 4RG London ',NULL,0,51.4909713,'Millbank SW1P 4RG London ',-0.1260642,'Monday - Sunday : 10:00 - 18:00',NULL,'');

Active from the 1960s, Khakhar was part of a lively new wave of narrative painting and figuration by artists in India that became known as the Baroda School. His practice evolved from the careful study of art from South Asian and European sources, even while he continued to work as an accountant part-time. After early experiments with Pop art, Khakhar developed a style of painting that combined both high and low, popular and painterly aesthetics, cleverly subverting popular iconography. He confronted complex and provocative themes with candour: class difference; desire and homosexuality; and his personal battle with cancer. Also a writer, his critical observations and literary sensibility were evident in his sharp, often ironic depictions of difficult subjects.The first posthumous survey of Khakhar’s career to be held in the UK, this exhibition brings together his work from across five decades and from collections around the world. In his lifetime Khakhar exhibited frequently in India and abroad, including Documenta IX in Kassel in 1992. While he has been included in group exhibitions at Tate in the past, this retrospective will shed new light on his practice by presenting well known works on canvas and paper alongside rarely seen experimental works including textile, glass and ceramics.','N/A',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'Bankside, London SE1 9TG',NULL,0,51.5081292,'Bankside, London SE1 9TG',-0.0951869,'Sunday - Thursday : 10:00 - 18:00, Friday - Saturday : 10:00 - 22:00',NULL,'');

Whether exploring conventional photographic modes such as street photography,portraiture, landscape and still life, or abandoning the camera altogether to produce abstract prints made by exposing different materials to light, Tillmansretains a sense of experimentation throughout his practice. This desire to push boundaries, to constantly question the photographic art form, has established Tillmans as one of the leading contemporary artists working today. WolfgangTillmans pictures from New World is a selection of photographs from the Turner Prize-winner’s recent series Neue Welt (New World). Following 10 years of abstract and conceptual work, the project marks Tillman’s re-enchantment with the simple act of looking at the world as it is. In these images, made over several years of local and international travel, the glass and steel of glitzy shopping malls are juxtaposed with the dust and colour of distant street markets. Skies of unblemished blue are countered by scrapyards and gutters. In one photo, fungus creeps up the side of a tree trunk, the organic mirror image of the ever-upward climb of urban environments – captured here also in the form of a cluttered view that unfolds before the artist from the window of a Shanghai hotel. Collapsing the known into the unknown, the exotic into the everyday, the old into the new, Tillmans’ Neue Welt observes multiple places – from Papua New Guinea to Nottingham – in a manner curious, compelling and highly original.

Since 2002, Donachie has worked with a range of scientific and medical professionals in collaborative processes to produce new ideas and artworks. This exciting new commission with GoMA, supported by a Wellcome Trust Arts Award, includes sculpture and drawings made in the last five years alongside new works developed from a period of research with a group of women affected by an inherited genetic condition, made in collaboration with the UK Myotonic Dystrophy Patient Registry at The John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre in Newcastle. This rich archive of personal reflection on age, appearance and disability offers a powerful platform for new work. Through connecting the thoughts of the women on their position within science and the treatment that affects them with established sculptural language that uses industrial materials, drawing and film, Donachie seeks to parallel the relationships and hierarchy of families with that of science, within the context of contemporary art. The exhibition will also reference items of armour from Glasgow Museums collection, urban architecture and works from an earlier sculptural and performance tradition such as that of Bruce McLean.Central to the exhibition is the new film work Hazel, a powerful three screen installation that directly connects the experiences of the participants - all sister sets, where one sibling has inherited the myotonic dystrophy gene and one has not – to a wider discussion around relationships, age and appearance. There will be a talks and workshop programme looking at the sculptural, drawing and film language Donachie employs, related to themes within the exhibition. This programme will culminate in a symposium on Friday 4 November, bringing together key academics, artists, patients, interested colleagues and audiences to take forward some of the ambitions raised by the commission with the Wellcome Trust Arts Award.

Klein’s art sought to express infinite space and immateriality achieved through pure colour, principally his own invented pigment International Klein Blue (IKB). This signature pigment was deployed in painting, sculpture and performance. Klein’s expansive theories led him to use non-conventional materials for making art such as fire and gold leaf.

Warboys often employs natural elements in making her works. The exhibition will feature specially commissioned Sea Paintings, which will immerse the galleries overlooking Porthmeor Beach, in floor-to-ceiling colour.

An installation of objects that reoccur across Warboys’ practice in film, performance and exhibitions, will be designed for the showcase. New forms and paintings will be also included in this one-off playful installation. A suite of films made in the UK, will be presented in the final room: Pageant Roll 2012, made in the ancient landscape of the Cornish moors; Boudica 2014, which explores both the historic character and her namesake, the Boudicca Way in Norfolk; and a new film, Hill of Dreams 2015, which has been specially commissioned by Tate St Ives, Casa Masaccio San Giovanni Valdarno, Italy and Kunsthall Stavanger, Norway. It draws from Welsh fantasy writer Arthur Machen’s book of the same name, a semi-autobiographical novel written in 1907 that relives his childhood memories of a rural Gwent, where Warboys too was born a century later.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Georgiana Houghton (1814-1884) was a Spiritualist medium who, in the 1860s and 70s, produced an astonishing series of abstract watercolours. Detailed explanations on the back of the works declare that her hand was guided by various spirits, including several Renaissance artists, as well as higher angelic beings. In this exhibition The Courtauld Galley explores this astounding series of largely abstract Victorian watercolours and offers visitors a unique opportunity to view remarkable works which have not been shown in the UK for nearly 150 years. Houghton was a prominent figure of the early spiritualist movement in Victorian England, which played a significant role in various spheres of nineteenth-century culture and was later championed by such influential figures as Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Spiritualism emerged as the belief that contact with a spirit realm was possible and that such communication could bring one closer to God. Houghton, a trained artist as well as a medium, pioneered the use of drawing as a method of channelling and expressing communications with spirit entities. During the 1860s and 1870s, she produced a series of unprecedented abstract watercolours as part of her practice as a spirit medium. Houghton called these works ‘spirit drawings’. Houghton’s spirit drawings are remarkably complex and layered watercolours. Technically highly accomplished, their bold colours and fluid forms have a mesmerising and deeply absorbing effect. Detailed inscriptions on the back of the works declare that her hand was guided by various spirits, including family members, several Renaissance artists, such as Titian and Correggio and higher angelic beings. These inscriptions, which are a form of automatic writing, also make clear that Houghton’s richly patterned compositions are intended to be faithful visualisations of aspects of the spirit realm and designed to inspire and strengthen the spiritual life of their viewers. Although produced in a very different context, Houghton’s abstract works have close connections to the ways in which twentieth- century artists developed abstract languages of art to transcend the everyday realm of representation and consciousness. In 1871 Houghton rented a prestigious gallery space in Bond Street and presented 155 of her spirit drawings to a perplexed London audience. The Critic from The Era newspaper pronounced it to be “The most astonishing exhibition in London at the present moment.” The Daily News likened the works to “tangled threads of coloured wool” and concluded that “They deserve to be seen as the most extraordinary and instructive example of artistic aberration.” The exhibition proved to be a commercial failure and nearly bankrupted Houghton. Although she continued to make spirit drawings after the exhibition, her ambition of popularising the practice was not realised. Today, less than fifty of her works are known.','Georgiana Houghton:

His modest resources shaped his DIY approach and led him to incorporate found objects as a foundation for making his adornments; early creations questioned established material hierarchies and were testimony to the harsh realities of industrial and economic decline. It was during this period that he encountered a range of creative individuals including Derek Jarman, Anthony Price, John Maybury and Leigh Bowery who championed his inventive approach to making fashion accessories.
In 1985 Blame helped John Moore to set up The House of Beauty and Culture in Dalston, London, a craft collective of like-minded artists including Fiona Skinner, Dave Baby, Fiona Bowen, John Flett, Peter Foster, Mark Lebon, Alan Macdonald & Fritz Solomon (Fric & Frack), Richard Torry and Christopher Nemeth. This collective experience proved to be the first of many important collaborations as a consultant with various designers including John Galliano, Rifat Ozbek, Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garçons, Gareth Pugh, Marc Jacobs and Kim Jones at Louis Vuitton.A further significant figure in Blame’s continued growth as a creative polymath was Ray Petri, nexus of the pseudo-corporate fashion collective Buffalo, who encouraged him to focus his talents as a fashion stylist. Blame was soon producing iconic fashion editorials with a range of photographers including Mark Lebon, Mark Mattock, Jean Baptiste Mondino and Juergen Teller for publications such as i-D, BLITZ and The Face. His instinctive ability to create symbolic images that embodied radical elements of popular culture and fashion led to an extensive career in the music industry as an art director and image consultant for iconic figures such as Boy George, Neneh Cherry, Kylie Minogue, Massive Attack and Bjork. Throughout his career Blame has maintained his artistic foundation, making jewellery from found and re-purposed objects. These pieces continue to inspire alongside his prolific contributions on social media, revealing his idiosyncratic and resourceful approach to life through images and objects.The exhibition is presented as a montage rather than a chronology that brings together an arrangement of artefacts, including clothing, collages, jewellery, fashion editorials, sketchbooks and T-shirts alongside unique commissions that bear witness to Blame’s tactile, thought-provoking, approach to fashion and his propensity towards collaboration and experimentation.

The Neo Naturists were an important live art collective initiated in 1981 by Jennifer Binnie, Christine Binnie and Wilma Johnson. The group emerged as a part of London’s subculture that arose from the squatting community in the aftermath of Punk and the emergence of the New Romantic club scene and the advent of Thatcherism. During this time a creative energy developed in the UK that sat outside established institutional practices of the time, creating its own network of activities, events, economies and personalities. The Neo Naturists were a part of an incredible cultural network of collaborators and peers that included significant figures such as BodyMap (Stevie Stewart & David Holah), Leigh Bowery, Michael Clark, Peter Doig, Boy George, John Maybury, Bruce Lacey, Andrew Logan, Grayson Perry, Derek Jarman, Princess Julia, Peter Robinson (Marilyn), Test Department and Cerith Wyn Evans.Combining ideas of ancient rituals with contemporary life, The Neo Naturists performed wearing little more than body paint in nightclubs, galleries, festivals and at unannounced site-specific public performances. Their celebration of a particular kind of anarchic innocence and deliberate primitivism provided a unique artistic voice within a cultural landscape that was otherwise dominated by a male perspective. Accordingly, their work engages with a range of complex issues surrounding gender, representation and performance. The retrospective at Studio Voltaire will focus on elements taken from their archive from 1980–1992 and will include video footage of original performances, photographic documentation, costumes, paintings and ephemera from their performances. This project will not follow the archetypal archive exhibition format, instead Studio Voltaire will stage a live archive exhibition. During the run up to the exhibition, the three original members of the group will work in-residency in the gallery, body printing and painting directly onto the gallery walls. An integral aspect of the retrospective will be the re-staging of key performances. During the exhibition’s run, The Neo Naturists will takeover the theatre space at the ICA for a night of immersive performance, film and music. Studio Voltaire occasionally presents special historical projects, providing an important platform for practices that sit outside of contemporary discourses or have been somewhat underrepresented by larger institutions. In 2012, Studio Voltaire presented a retrospective of Jo Spence. This was an important opportunity to allow audiences to experience a significant presentation of the photographer’s practice first-hand. In doing so, we hoped that the exhibition would allow for an increased recognition of the relevance of her practice. As a direct result of the exhibition, key works were subsequently acquired by Tate Collection and are currently on display at Tate Britain. Building upon the success of this project, we will present the first historical survey of The Neo Naturists work in a public institution.

In a new series of video installations, the New York-based duo exposes the vast amount of unpalatable material kept away from our screens by an army of underpaid workers, while offering a bizarre but telling glimpse into the lives of an ever-growing, dispersed global workforce.
 
Dark Content (2015-ongoing), the centrepiece of the show, probes into the Internet’s most secret corners by looking closely at the largely anonymous labour force of content moderators that has emerged with the rise of social media. Content moderators are in essence the gatekeepers to any material accessed online. Their role is to screen all uploads according to specific corporate standards of propriety: making sure beheadings and gang rapes don’t crop up in our Facebook news feeds, and nipples don’t surprise us on Instagram. Along with the major corporations that employ them, these de facto patrols of the Internet shape our daily existence. With each ‘yes’ or ‘no’, they edit the experience of our culture in the name of many different forces: political, moral, ethical, even religious. Once the offending material has been removed, it’s virtually impossible to know it was ever there.
 
Content moderation is for the most part a very discreet service as the companies who hire this workforce seek to present themselves as free and transparent tools of self-expression. The moderators in turn often hide their work from their friends and families, preferring not to acknowledge the kinds of things they are required to witness everyday. Over a period of more than a year, the Mattes interviewed a number of them about their work. These conversations developed into a series of video episodes – first released on the Darknet – with the interviewees’ identities withheld through the use of voice software and stock avatars, a further distancing from both the person and the content itself. Each video is displayed in sculptural surrounds made from mass-produced office furniture, alluding to the home offices and identikit office cubicles around the world where this work often takes place. Alongside, a new series of wall-mounted insulation panels are printed with corporate moderation guidelines that were leaked to the artists in the course of their investigations. They serve as a reminder that this act of filtering and ‘safeguarding’ is always a reflection of the ideology of the organisation commissioning it.
 
By Everyone For No One Every Day (BEFNOED, 2014) also calls attention to a new form of labour in the digital age. For this series, the artists used a range of crowdsourcing websites to give instructions to anonymous workers to realise a variety of absurd performances for webcam. The artists laid out instructions for them to follow and interpret. Once received, the videos are dispersed on obscure, peripheral or forgotten social networks around the world. While for Dark Content the artists act as a sort of confidante, here their position is more complex, as their unusual demands appear to both entertain and exploit their performers. In the gallery, the placement of the monitors in the space is such that, in order to watch the work, viewers are forced into a series of physically awkward and bizarre positions, in a sense taking on the role of performers themselves.
 
In much the same way that the performances are crowd-sourced in BEFNOED, the production of their series Image Search Result (2014-ongoing) is entirely outsourced to the Internet. For each work on display, the artists have selected a search term from their personal browsing history in their preparation for this exhibition. Adopting an idea purchased from a fellow artist, they take the first image a search engine yields for that term and have it printed on a range of objects by online custom printing services. Once produced, the objects are delivered directly to the exhibition venue, where they are unpacked, exhibited and seen by the artists for the first time.
 
Eva and Franco Mattes share a long-held fascination with the invisible. In Emily’s Video (2012), they show a disturbing video sourced on the Darknet only through the reactions of its viewers. They’ve also programmed a computer virus (Biennale.py, 2001), and co-curated an inaccessible exhibition in the Fukushima exclusion zone (Don’t Follow The Wind, 2015). For the New York-based duo, what’s concealed is often what matters most.

From 1993 until 1998 a group of Londoners, loosely affiliated to the artworld, would open their post to discover some surprising documents – a crumpled piece of paper; a transcription of the graffiti in the men’s toilets at the British Library; an exam paper for failed artists. The anonymous sender was curator Matthew Higgs. His curatorial platform was the A5 envelope; his production studio, the photocopier.

Higgs, now director of White Columns in New York, is an artist, writer and pioneering curator. Having witnessed the phenomenal rise of young British artists in the early 1990s, he contacted those he knew and admired and invited them to make a work for his mail art project, Imprint 93.

This is the first time that every edition of Imprint 93 is on display and features a stellar line-up of artists including Billy Childish, Martin Creed, Jeremy Deller, Peter Doig, Ceal Floyer, Alan Kane, Elizabeth Peyton, Chris Ofili, Bob and Roberta Smith, Jessica Voorsanger and Stephen Willats.

Featuring 17 leading international artists and including four new commissions, all works are drawn from the Zabludowicz Collection and produced since the year 2000.

Exhibiting artists: Korakrit Arunanondchai (TH), Neïl Beloufa (FR), David Blandy (UK), David Raymond Conroy (UK), Andrea Crespo (US), Simon Denny (NZ), Aleksandra Domanović (YU), Ed Fornieles (UK), Michael Fullerton (UK), Guan Xiao (CN), Eloise Hawser (UK), Ann Hirsch (US), Pierre Huyghe (FR), Daniel Keller (US), Christopher Kulendran Thomas (UK), Seth Price (US), Frances Stark (US)

Emotional Supply Chains explores how a fluid sense of self is fabricated in our digital present via a supply chain of objects, ideas and experiences. Although we increasingly interact within \'virtual\'  space, this remains bound to tangible locations and circumstances. The exhibiting artists reflect on the tensions between confinement and escape, happiness and anxiety, and presence and absence. The exhibition is structured into three parts, each exploring aspects of contemporary identity: the dualities of self, the performed and networked self, and origins and renewal.

Projects inspired by dualities of self include; Simon Denny\'s, The Personal Effects of Kim Dotcom, 2013 (ongoing), reimagined for the Main Gallery space, Thai-born, New York-based artist Korakrit Arunanondchai’s exploration of East and West pop cultural excess and spiritual depth in his video Painting with history in a room filled with people with funny names 3, 2015, and David Raymond Conroy’s new video commission questioning the ethics of artist as tourist, created following time spent in Las Vegas as part of Zabludowicz Collection\'s inaugural residency programme in November/December 2015. 

In 2011, fascinated by how Facebook shapes the narratives of people’s lives, Ed Fornieles produced Dorm Daze, an ambitious project enlisting 32 volunteers to enact a three month long Facebook ‘sitcom’. For this exhibition, the archive of the performance has been reconceived in a new installation and sound piece. Similarly, Frances Stark uses Instagram to communicate beyond the confines of the art world, gaining and entertaining ‘followers’ and interweaving the realities of life as artist, teacher and mother. Drawing on existing writing, Ann Hirsch has developed a new video installation reflecting on a loss of innocence both personally and for the internet more widely, as it shifted from unregulated chat rooms into branded and monitored platforms. These works have been brought together in a mapping of the evolution of social media from AOL chat and message boards to the Web 2.0 of Facebook and Instagram.

In the final section, artists examine the intersection of place and personal history. David Blandy’s installation Child of the Atom, 2010,was inspired by a family myth connecting his late grandfather, a Japanese prisoner of war, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Aleksandra Domanović’s biography and practice are marked by the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 2003. Twin screen video work 19:30, 2010–11, brings together imagery central to identity in her home region: an anthology of news themes from state-owned broadcast stations, and original and found footage from rave parties. Pierre Huyghe’s video One Million Kingdoms, 2001, forms part of a seminal project initiated with Philippe Parreno in 1999. Together they acquired the rights to a manga character called Annlee, with the intention of lifting a generic character out of anonymity and into the role of central protagonist in a series of international art projects. Relinquishing their rights to her in 2001, this video shows Annlee on a journey into her own vanishing.

A fully illustrated publication featuring exclusive content from each of the exhibiting artists, plus a new essay by Laurence Scott and previously unpublished poetry by Sam Riviere, will be available during the run of the show.

An extensive public programme of live events, talks and performances will take place throughout the exhibition. Affordable limited edition art works by a number of the artists in the exhibition will also be available in the gallery and online.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Waddington Custot Galleries presents Vibration of Space, an exhibition examining the artistic exchange between British painter Patrick Heron (1920-1999) and the non-figurative painters of post-war Paris. Spanning the years 1945–65, the exhibition highlights Heron’s admiration of three artists in particular - Hans Hartung (1904–89), Pierre Soulages (b. 1919) and Nicolas de Staël (1914–55). The exhibition will focus on this overlooked dialogue between European and British artists in the post-war years, a period dominated by the emergence of American Abstract Expressionism.
 
Heron’s own interest in the Parisian art scene was piqued in 1949 when he saw paintings by Soulages at the Salon de Mai. A couple of years later, in 1951, Heron visited the de Staël exhibition held at Mathiesen’s Gallery in London which proved to be a turning point in his career. The exhibition includes Heron’s first abstract painting ‘Square Leaves (Abstract): July 1952’, which echoes de Staël’s ‘fat little squares or oblongs of thick, brushed paint’.[1]
 
Vibration of Space takes as its starting point Heron’s essay Space in Painting and Architecture (1953) in which he argued that by 1950, non-figurative painting in Paris had become the most significant movement in French art since Cubism. For Heron, space became the medium itself. He cited Soulages in particular for acknowledging and manipulating the illusory sense of space which existed within the flat surface of a painting, as compared to the pre-war artists who denied its presence. The materiality of paint is acknowledged and it’s application producing a visible grain on the painting’s surface. Heron believed this created a ‘vibration of space’, a key element which he brought to his own work of this period and valued so much in the work of Hartung, Soulages and de Staël.
 
Heron’s prolific writing on these artists gave the Parisian painters a voice in London. After receiving photographs of a painting sent by Heron, Soulages remarked, ‘This photograph has increased my understanding of your interest in space and its prominent role in your reflections on painting. By the way, I agree with you on this point entirely, which makes what you write about my painting all the more meaningful’.[2]
 
Heron’s conversion to pure non-figurative abstraction began around 1952, but it was not until the mid-fifties that his artistic style changed completely. He presented his stripe paintings, which were the first of their kind, at a group show in 1957 at Redfern Gallery. Despite being heavily criticised, the stripe paintings have since become hugely influential. Small Red Verticals: March 1957 and Vertical Stripes 1956 are included in Waddington Custot Galleries’ exhibition and are early examples of Heron’s use of this revolutionary motif.
 
As Alan Bowness (Director of Tate 1980-1988) later stated, ‘that very unpopular strand which the vertical paintings represented in 1957 has been seen to be a central issue to the development of painting in our time.’[3] Heron’s controversial early adoption and championing of an art form which has now become a celebrated art historical movement, demonstrates his importance in both the history of European post-war art and within twentieth century art criticism.','Vibration of Space',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'11 Cork Street W1S 3LT London',NULL,0,51.5101099,'11 Cork Street W1S 3LT London',-0.1416207,'Monday - Friday : 10:00 - 18:00, Saturday : 10:00 - 13.30',NULL,'www.waddingtoncustot.com');
insert into venue values (NULL,'In the autumn of 1976, a group of painters from Italy’s northern Trentino region published their ‘Manifesto of Objective Abstraction’. Reacting against what they considered to be the superficiality of contemporary culture, Mauro Cappelletti, Diego Mazzonelli, Gianni Pellegrini, Aldo Schmid, Luigi Senesi and Giuseppe Wenter Marini called for a renewed attention to the painterly process and its fundamentally abstract concerns.

Although each artist possessed a unique and independent artistic vision, what united them was their desire to make colour the focal point of their artistic practice, exploring its optical and perceptual effects. As the group’s name suggests, instinct was set aside in favour of discipline and control, resulting in the creation of an impersonal, intellectual art that minimised the importance of an emotional response on the part of either the artist or the viewer.

This exhibition explores a little-known moment in Italian painting, but one that nevertheless represents an important phase in the evolution of abstract art in post-war Italy. It is also the first show in Britain to focus on the group, and presents a number of important pieces by each of its members.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Tintype is pleased to announce that Nicole Vinokur is our project space artist for 2016.
The Tintype project space is an annual event in which an artist is invited to use the
gallery as a studio or working space followed by a show. Previous artists have been An
Gee Chan, Tom Woolner, Florence Peake, Beth Collar, and Holly Slingsby.
Nicole Vinokur’s Paridayda is an experiment in turning inside space into a faux outside.
The project stems from a fable about an Indian ship which docked at an English port.
The crew asked to be taken to walk on grass as they lived surrounded by metal. They
were taken to walk barefoot in a nearby graveyard – then returned to their ship to live
surrounded by metal once again.
The meadow indoors is consciously located within a space and dislocated from its origin.
Vinokur’s intention is to cultivate a meadow and once it has become established to
offer it as an immersive installation alongside a series of ‘graving walks’ to some of north
London’s many churchyards and cemeteries; “I am interested in creating a sensory
space of encounter in which concentrated experience and closeness to our own
materiality and mortality can come into focus.”
Paridayda is the Old Persian root for the word ‘paradise’ which literally translates as
“walled enclosure” relating to oases. This was later adopted by Greek as paradeisos to
denote areas of cultivated walled gardens or parks. Vinokur’s reframing of a meadow
inside a gallery, offers an incongruous phenomenon – for the final week the public will
be invited to walk barefoot, sit or rest within the space.
Material, physicality, process and impermanence – the accretions of time through
layering, are motifs of Nicole Vinokur’s interdisciplinary practice. Her monumental piece
Giotto’s Cosmic Crush, constructed from chalk, marble dust plaster and a single bronze
cast fly is suggestive of a sarcophagus or tomb and integrates notions of tromp l’oeil; the
‘lure of the gaze’ (Lacan), disrupting the relationship between image and reality.','Paridayda',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'107 Essex Road N1 2SL London',NULL,0,51.5389478,'107 Essex Road N1 2SL London',-0.0989017,'Wednesday - Saturday : 12:00 - 18:00, or by appointment',NULL,'www.tintypegallery.com');

This exhibition will bring together Katz’s extraordinarily productive output of recent years alongside works from across his career in an installation that responds and relates to the unique context of the Serpentine Gallery. Coming of age as an artist in 1950s New York, Katz developed his unique approach to contemporary representational painting during the height of Abstract Expressionism. 
Over the five and a half decades since his first exhibition in 1954, Katz has produced a celebrated body of work, including paintings, drawings, sculpture and prints. Establishing himself as a pre-eminent painter of modern life, he was influenced by films, billboard advertising, music, poetry and his close circle of friends and family. His portraits and landscapes are characterised by their flatness of colour and fluidity of line, reinventing both genres within the context of abstract painting and contemporary image-making.
The Serpentine exhibition takes landscape as its focus, bringing together Katz’s extraordinarily productive output of recent years alongside select works from the past two decades. Katz’s landscape paintings exemplify his life-long quest to capture the present tense in paint. Regardless of their scale, Katz describes these paintings as ‘environmental’ in the way in which they envelop the viewer. Defined by temporal qualities of light, times of the day and the changing of the seasons, these paintings respond and relate to the unique context of the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens. The exhibition will also include a recent series of portraits and expand beyond the walls of the gallery into the park with a new cut-out sculpture.
Katz draws parallels between his approach to painting and his interest in poetry, both equally concerned with stripping away unnecessary detail to leave only the essential information. This relationship between language and the painting process is echoed in the work of painter, poet and filmmaker Etel Adnan, showing in parallel at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, whose landscapes are similarly defined by their bold colour and simplified form that is nevertheless rooted in keen observation of the world around her.','Quick Light',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'Kensington Gardens W2 3XA London',NULL,0,51.5047891,'Kensington Gardens W2 3XA London',-0.1750075,'Monday - Sunday : 10:00 - 18:00',NULL,'www.serpentinegallery.org');
insert into venue values (NULL,'Serpentine Galleries presents the works of painter, essayist and poet Etel Adnan, who was born in 1925 in Beirut, Lebanon. In her first solo exhibition in a UK public institution, the Serpentine shows work from across her career and including paintings, drawings, poetry, film and tapestry. After studying at the Sorbonne and then Harvard, in the late 1950s Adnan taught philosophy at the University of California and started to paint.
While these early works were largely abstract compositions - with squares of colour applied directly from the tube - she was interested in the immediate beauty of colour. Her earliest paintings were suggestive of landscapes and included forms that referenced specific places. In the 1970s she moved to the area near Mount Tamalpais in California, which became the central subject matter of numerous paintings and poems.  
From the 1960s until the present day Adnan has also made tapestries, inspired by the feeling and colour of the Persian rugs of her childhood. Never translating existing paintings into tapestries, she uses specific designs for her textile works. Over the course of the 1960s, Adnan moved away from purely abstract forms and, in 1964, discovered ‘leporellos’, accordion-folded sketchbooks in which she could mix drawing with writing and poetry. Often working in series, her painting continued to move between recognisable and imagined forms, revealing her sensitivity to colour and shape extracted from the environments in which she found herself.
Her writing, too, contains multiple references and responses to the politics and violence in the world around her. From her earliest poem in English, which addressed the Vietnam War, to her award-winning 1978 novel Sitt Marie-Rose, she explores the political and personal dimensions of violence and articulates her experience of exile from familiar landscapes and languages. 
Adnan’s artworks feature in numerous collections, including Centre Pompidou, Paris; Mathaf, Doha, Qatar; Royal Jordanian Museum; Tunis Modern Art Museum; Sursock Museum, Beirut; Institut du Monde Arabe, Paris; British Museum, London; World Bank Collection, Washington D.C.; National Museum for Women in the Arts, Washington D.C. In 2014, Adnan was awarded France\'s highest cultural honour, the Ordre de Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres.
Adnan has participated in a number of Serpentine events during the past six years including the On Edgware Road group exhibition in 2012; the Map Marathon (2010); the Garden Marathon (2011); the Memory Marathon (2012), and the Extinction Marathon (2015).

The dinosaur is approximately 200 million years old, the oldest Jurassic dinosaur ever found in the UK. It belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs and is related to Tyrannosaurus rex, although our dinosaur was walking the earth about 130 million years earlier than its more well known cousin. The new Welsh dinosaur is a completely new species, previously unknown to scientists, making this discovery even more exciting. What do we know about this new Welsh dinosaur?
-        It was a carnivorous predator, eating small mammals, lizards and other reptiles
-        It walked on two legs and had a long tail
-        It was a warm-blooded animal and much of its body was probably covered in feathery down with quills along its back
-        This dinosaur died young at about 50cm tall. If it had grown to its full size, it may have been approximately 80cm tall
-        It lived near the sea, in a time when the Welsh climate was more like the Mediterranean and the seas were shallow and warm
-        It died close to the shoreline then its body was washed out to sea and settled on the sea bed, where it became fossilised with the marine sediment and other small creatures such as sea urchins and small fish. The rocks containing the fossilised dinosaur bones were found on the beach at Lavernock, Vale of Glamorgan, by two brothers Rob and Nick Hanigan, in March 2014. The keen fossil hunters were out for a walk, checking over the latest rock fall from the cliffs above, when they noticed interesting shapes in the rocks and took them away for closer examination. Scientists at National Museum Cardiff were able to identify the type of dinosaur and worked with palaeontologists at other institutions, including Dr David Martill at Portsmouth University, to establish this brand new species of dinosaur, never seen before. More recently, fossilised bones from the foot of this dinosaur were found by Sam Davies in August 2015. The fossils are contained in four blocks of rock, which will be on display in the Main Hall at National Museum Cardiff until 31 December 2016.','Wales\'s Newest Dinosaur

Book your tickets online in advance to avoid disappointment for this inspirational exhibition.rarily closed due to industrial action. We will update this page with the latest information. To celebrate 2016, The Year of Adventure in Wales, we\'re hosting extraordinary treasures from popular culture including the hat, whip and jacket of Indiana Jones, crystal skulls, Inca gold and early finds such as Egyptian Mummies. The exhibition will tell the stories behind great archaeological discoveries from the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Rome, Pre-Columbian America and Rapa Nui (Easter Island), some of which have never been seen in Wales before. It will include a whole host of fascinating objects and treasures from ancient worlds as well as more recent examples uncovered in Wales. You\'ll be encouraged to follow in the footsteps of archaeologists - historical and fictional - to uncover the stories behind some of the world’s ancient treasures. Star objects will include: an Egyptian mummy, Roman treasures, a crystal skull from the film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, thanks to Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, human skulls from Viking-age burials at Llanbedrgoch, Anglesey, a 19th-century crystal skull from Musée du Quai Branly, Paris. The archaeological investigations of individuals such as Giovanni Belzoni (Italian explorer and pioneer archaeologist of Egyptian antiquities), Flinders Petrie (Egyptologist) and Adela Breton (archaeological artist and explorer) will be explored. This will be contrasted with adventure today and the impact of archaeological discoveries on popular culture, fiction and film, from Tintin and Indiana Jones to Rider Haggard and Conan Doyle. There\'s a story-writing competition for children too. No photography is allowed in the gallery due to the conditions attached to many of the loan items on display. Postcards of some items from our own collections are available in the gift shop and some objects are featured in the museum publication “Discovered in Time” also available in the shop (including the Nant Col Hoard and the Dolgellau Chalice and Paten).','Treasures: Adventures in Archaeology

insert into venue values (NULL,'Art, design, craft and technology are often considered as separate disciplines. However, there is a long, alternative tradition that views them in a holistic way, both as tools for learning and as part of a wider culture that values making as central to society. This integrated understanding of creative practice manifests in various lines of thought, organisations and movements. Examples include the ‘mechanical arts’ of medieval times; the Mechanics Institutes and the Arts and Crafts of the nineteenth century; the Steiner schools, Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Pedagogy of the Oppressed in the twentieth century; and makerspaces of today. This display brings together works from the Middlesbrough Collection, with an emphasis on ceramics and contemporary jewellery. The pieces are grouped thematically, allowing connections to emerge through social use. Rotating presentations feature projects devised by local constituencies and artists who explore topical issues. Here you can research the Middlesbrough Collection, join regular workshops, organise meetings, and lead or participate in making sessions. The Middlesbrough Collection was inherited from the former Cleveland Crafts Centre, Cleveland Gallery and Middlesbrough Art Gallery. It holds approximately 2,250 works from around 1900 to the present time, with strengths in post–Second World War British and international drawing, twentieth-century British ceramics and contemporary international jewellery. One significant segment of the Middlesbrough Collection, devoted to innovative ways of understanding and practicing jewellery, was initiated at Cleveland Craft Centre in the early 1980s under the guidance of the curator Ralph Turner. Artists Otto Künzli, Emmy Van Leersum and Gijs Bakker and Wendy Ramshaw are among many who were key to the development of a new, experimental approach to jewellery from the 1960s onwards. Their works explore utility, narrative, value, material, shape and scale.
The ceramics in the Middlesbrough Collection chart the evolution of the Studio Pottery movement from the early 1900s to today, focusing on British production. This section includes items by the renowned UK-based ceramicists Hans Coper, Lucie Rie and Bernard Leach as well as sculptural pieces by artists Grayson Perry and Edmund de Waal, among others. Their works suggest considerations of function and decoration, and how the two can intersect in surprising manners.','Centre for Social Making: Middlesbrough Collection display

It shines a light on the recent headlines around housing conditions for asylum seekers in Middlesbrough. Contributors and artists include the Collection of Investing in People and Culture, Right to Remain, Babi Badalov, Chto Delat, Burlesque Design, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Isabel Lima, Stephanie Misa, and Zanny Begg & Oliver Ressler, among others.

According to the organisation’s website, the Home Office is the government department responsible for immigration, counter-terrorism, police, drugs policy and related science and research.

The exhibition includes two of Güell’s key works: Humanitarian Aid (2008-13) and Stateless by Choice (2015-16). The former documents an exchange of services, with Güell offering herself in marriage to anyone wanting to emigrate from Cuba to Spain. The latter considers the historical roots of nationalism, with Güell engaging in a legal process, informed by self-determination ideologies, to challenge her national identity. In her practice Güell addresses issues of legality, power, ethics, and morality. She employs tactics associated with activism, regularly using her persona as subject matter or collaborating with people in a variety of contexts. Her works challenge, and often subvert, the political status quo, mainstream lifestyles, gender divisions, and dominant economies.
Güell lives and works in Barcelona. She graduated from the University of Barcelona and continued her studies under Tania Bruguera at the Cátedra Arte de Conducta in Cuba. She exhibits regularly across the globe; recent highlights include a solo show at Project Arts Centre in Dublin (2016) and participation in the Kyiv Biennial (2015), the Athens Biennial (2013), and the Göteborg Biennial (2013).

Known for working with film, video and photography to explore the politics, architecture and technology of conflict, the artists frequently engage in research with academics and other specialists. The exhibition includes a large-scale video installation, Undead Sun, and work specially created for this occasion. Undead Sun: We Put the World Before You examines the enormous impact of the First World War on society. At the core of the exhibition is a consideration of how so many of the technological and social products of that era continue to shape contemporary experience.
A new video scrutinises the relationship between the psychological and physical trauma of the First World War and advancements in technology. It looks at the development of early prosthetics, which were devised and employed in the 1910s to aid scars left by the conflict, and investigates the connection between these procedures and current facial imaging techniques and reconstructive surgery. This exhibition forms the second stage in a three-part project. Commissioned by FVU, for IWM (Imperial War Museums), in partnership with MIMA, Middlesbrough and Wolverhampton Art Gallery.

It brings together works in which she approached the genres of landscape, still life and portrait alongside her experiments with abstraction, with particular emphasis on the way she treated light and colour. The works were developed throughout her career, taking inspiration from the places in which she lived or that she visited. These include her native Cumbria and surroundings in Lugano, Switzerland, in the early 1920s; trips to southern France and Paris in the 1930s and The Hebrides in the 1950s; and Greece in the 1960s. Throughout her career Nicholson was interested in prisms. Inspired by her use of these geometric figures, she developed these interests in the last few years of her life, often painting pictures that verged on the abstract. Many of them unseen, and a key feature of the show, Nicholson’s prismatic pictures were a culmination of her search to find “form’s secret and rhythmic law”.','Winifred Nicholson: Liberation of Colour

Access to art works for women as both a catalyst for personal resistance and as a sometimes non-verbal way to communicate their experiences, which go on to affect and activate other women. The Women\'s Unit achieves its aims by identifying women themselves as experts within the context of their lived experience and by accepting the nuance of individual approaches in a non-determined way. With permission to do so, the women\'s work is then made public through exhibition, film and publication, so the work is distributed as a political act of visibility. the Women\'s Unit strives to provide a space that is accepting of women as they are, to make whatever they like.For their three weeks presence at CCA, the Women\'s Unit will be bringing their practice directly to the gallery space and inviting other women to come work and show with them in-situ, through talks, demos, an evolving exhibition and point of contact for women throughout the city.

The works debuted at Jerwood Space, London from 9 March to 24 April 2016.The artists’ works respond in different ways to the theme of ‘Borrowed Time’, with its allusion to escalating levels of personal and national debt and a wider feeling of economic unease or ecological threat caused by our exploitation of natural resources and the impact it has on the environment. The more we look to keep ourselves afloat in the present by deferring the costs to the future, the more we are reminded of how unsustainable this is. Both artists focus their explorations of the theme on the legacy of power stations. While Williams spotlights the speculative urban development that is taking place in and around London’s Battersea Power Station, Kramer considers the landscape around the Fukushima nuclear reactor as a symbol of man’s complex interaction with the natural world.

Curated by Bren O’Callaghan, Visual Art Programme Manager, HOME, and Sarah Perks, Artistic Director: Visual Art, HOME.Maclean uses the fairytale genre to examine the murky boundary between childhood and adulthood. She explores ideas of  happiness and childhood as qualities that can be packaged and sold resulting in dark and unsettling adventures located in a netherland reminiscent of the supersaturated, candy-coloured palette of children’s television.Centred on a linked series of three new video works, Wot u :-) about? also includes large format prints developed during her residency at Artpace, San Antonio, together with larger-than-life figurative sculptures directly relating to and overlapping with the props, costumes and aesthetic within the films.Resembling hybrids of bored commuters, cutesy kids’ TV monsters and sickeningly engorged biological organs, the sculptural figures also function as inanimate viewers for a series of infographic videos, displaying spreadsheets, bar graphs and market research surveys to their unblinking users. Playing on ideas about the cult of youth and the exaggerated enthusiasm of happiness marketing, they take the form of part playground-equipment, part grotesque and bloated mannequins, which upon closer inspection are being eaten alive by swarms of razor-toothed dolls.Alongside the exhibition we will publish the first major monograph of Rachel Maclean’s sweeter-than-candy adventures, featuring comprehensive imagery, stills and drawings from her dark, self-generated fairytale landscapes.The monograph includes contributions by Rachel Maclean, William Davies (author of The Happiness Industry: how the government and big business sold us well-being), Melissa Gronlund (writer and co-editor of Afterall Journal), and exhibition curators Bren O’Callaghan and Sarah Perks.

A window on a changing worldThis spring, Arnolfini and Bristol Museum & Art Gallery are working together to present a compelling exhibition of video, installation, photography and painting across two sites in central Bristol.Art from Elsewhere gathers 37 significant artists from 22 countries, whose socially-engaged work addresses life, politics and identity in a globalised society. The exhibition includes some of the most important artists working today, seminal figures in the history of conceptual art, and young artists whose work enters British museums for the first time.The culmination of a national tour, this specially-conceived and ambitious presentation for Bristol reflects the city’s historic significance as a port, our diverse cultures, and our place within a rapidly-changing world. The artworks pose fresh perspectives, new identities, glimpses of other lives, and important questions: not least, who is the insider and who is the outsider?Art from Elsewhere was born from a 2007 scheme, Art Fund International, which gave a regional consortium of museums the opportunity to spend up to one million pounds to acquire international art for the benefit of the public. The successful collections were Bristol Museum & Art Gallery, Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery with The New Art Gallery Walsall, Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art and Towner, Eastbourne. Jeremy Lewison, who has since become an Arnolfini Trustee, was mentor to the project, helping Bristol Museum & Art Gallery to devise a collecting strategy and, he and Tom Trevor, Arnolfini former director, provided advice to Bristol Museum & Art Gallery regarding their choice of new acquisitions.This Hayward Touring exhibition, curated by internationally-renowned curator David Elliott, highlights newly-collected works purchased through the scheme, and recognises the vital importance of continuing to enrich and share the collecting of contemporary art.','Art from Elsewhere: International Contemporary Art from UK Galleries ',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'16 Narrow Quay BS1 4QA Bristol',NULL,0,51.4490388,'16 Narrow Quay BS1 4QA Bristol',-2.5994184,'Monday - Sunday : 11:00 - 18:00',NULL,'');

Carl Andre \'is best known as a minimalist sculptor\' but in the exhibition, he is represented by some of his concrete poetry: ‘a form in which the visual order of the words or letters on the page is as important as the words themselves\'. Robert Smithson \'is best known for his monumental \'earth works\'\' but in Art from Elsewhere is represented by some of his \'phantasmagorical drawings of cosmological worlds...\'.

Inspired by the cultural landscape of her home, Abboud draws on the traditions of Palestinian folklore and myth-making by collecting stories and fairy tales. Investigating these story telling practices and oral histories, the artist provides new interpretations for the tales she has discovered.This exhibition brings together a body of recent work, including the series of drawings The Ballad of the Lady Who Lives Behind Trees 2005-14 and the film I Feel Nothing 2013, alongside a new video installation. Abboud\'s delicate drawings depict monsters and magical beings with the landscapes and sites they inhabit including grottos, wells and trees. Presented as a constellation, we are encouraged to weave these elements together and create our own narratives. I Feel Nothing is a video-poem inspired by a Palestinian folktale The Handless Maiden and Titian’s painting Noli me Tangere c. 1514. Filmed at the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge, the Freud Museum, London and locations throughout Palestine, the work explores notions of touch and territories of the body.Abboud’s three-channel video installation Hide Your Water from the Sun 2016, traces a 1920 study by physician and researcher Dr. Tawfiq Canaan into Palestinian customs and folklore. Canaan analyses ‘haunted locations’ that are primarily attributed to water sources and inhabited by various demons. Abboud, with cinematographer Issa Freij, has visited these locations, documenting the sites where the original wells and springs have long since disappeared.

After writing obituaries for the Daily Telegraph in London, he began producing obituaries of living subjects such as Bill Clinton and Jeff Koons, thus highlighting the blurred line between history and fiction. He is known for paintings employing wads of chewing gum on canvas that reference the bombing of German cities in the Second World War, and for machined graphite sculptures of such banal objects as a water cooler or an air conditioner. His repurposing of the over–familiar creates momentary ruptures, which in the words of one writer “jolt us temporarily out of our indifference, owing to over–exposure, toward the signs that dominate our daily lives.”Adam McEwen was born in 1965 in London, England. He received his B.A. in 1987 from Christ Church, Oxford, and then received his B.F.A. in 1991 from California Institute of the Arts, Valencia.

Wilkes is primarily known for her large-scale installations of seemingly disparate objects, many of which are distressed, damaged, altered or adapted. Her ensembles slowly evolve out of a working method that begins with the meticulous collection and selection of materials and ends with the measured task of arrangement, re-arrangement, making and re-making. The refined, physical manifestations of a continual process of intellectual introspection and existential questioning, Wilkes’s installations explore the multiplicity of meanings, both personal and universal, that objects are capable of evoking, or representing. Cathy Wilkes is also a painter. Her predominantly abstract works on canvas tend to mirror the intensive labour that goes into her installations – the canvases are worked on, set aside, scraped clean and worked on again. Previously incorporated into her sculptural environments, Wilkes’s paintings have gained greater autonomy in recent years.Cathy Wilkes (b. 1966, Belfast) lives and works in Glasgow.

The human striving to transform nature and a more recent nostalgic and aesthetic valuation of wilderness by an affluent society no longer in direct contact with nature.

Elsa Schiaparelli (1890-1973) is celebrated for her creativity both as an artist and as a fashion designer. Her love of bold designs led Chanel to question her skills in fashion, calling her ‘that Italian artist who makes dresses’. This is not untrue as she had a flair for memorable ‘artistic’ clothes, which were popular with flamboyant clients – women such as Marlene Dietrich or Wallis Simpson (Duchess of Windsor). She is certainly one of the most celebrated fashion designers of the middle twentieth century, and one of the few outstanding women couturiers.We are showing a small selection of iconic Schiaparelli outfits against a backdrop of other thirties fashion, outfits which might well have been influenced by her prominent designs.

On the first day alone, the British suffered more than 57,000 casualties, with almost 20,000 killed, and by the end of the campaign the Allies (Britain, France, Italy and Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria) had lost more than 1.5 million men.   In commemoration of the Somme and also to mark the other terrible battles of the First World War, this display brings together works of art from the collections of the Whitworth and Manchester Art Gallery, including paintings, drawings and prints by artists such as Paul Nash, C. R. W. Nevinson, David Bomberg and Henry Lamb, created out of their experiences on the front line of battle. Many of the images feature arable and wooded landscapes disfigured by mechanized war. Forests could be a place of shelter, but they were also fragile. Artists were profoundly sensitive to the destruction wrought by artillery and airpower on the natural environment and the malign creation of wounded bodies in need of medical attention. Their visions imply the mythical character of ancient landscapes, now tormented and scarred, with sodden craters and barren charred tree stumps that were seen as being akin to the bones of the dead.This exhibition has been co-curated by Dr. Ana Carden-Coyne, Co-Director of the Centre for the Cultural History of War in the University of Manchester, and David Morris, Head of Collections at the Whitworth.','Visions of the Front 1916-18 ',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'The Whitworth The University of Manchester Oxford Road M15 6ER Manchester',NULL,0,53.4602706,'The Whitworth The University of Manchester Oxford Road M15 6ER Manchester',-2.2314848,'Monday - Wednesday: 10:00 - 17:00, Thursday: 10:00 - 21:00, Friday - Sunday: 10:00 - 17:00',NULL,'');

The National Library of Wales recently cementing his reputation as one of the leading artists of his generation by acquiring one of his oils for Wales’ National Collection.Melegari creates enigmatic portrait paintings and admits that his work often produces a subject ‘who looks to be searching for his or her soul’, however, although he retains a fascination for the figure his real passion lies in the medium of the paint itself.‘The physicality of paint can create a figural imprint of the imagination. I am interested in the textural properties of oil paint, how it reacts with the canvas through drips and movement. I find that the versatility of the medium, through the body of paint, can replicate this sense of spontaneity, of change and fragility in human bodies and subjects.The artworks have a sculptural quality which is born from layering and scraping back the paint in a technique rooted in French Impressionism.  The dense impasto surface is created with palette knives, coarse paint brushes and fingers, allowing the paint to run and drip freely.This three dimensional element is no mistake.  Melegari was directly inspired by the American artist Manuel Neri whose plaster figures have the same eerie but compelling qualities found in his own work.Collectors have also consistently been drawn to his sensitive and subtle use of colour where he draws his delicate graduations of hue and tone from artists such as the Italian still life painter, Morandi.Morandi and Melegari share the same apparently repetitive subject material which to the discerning eye reveals an intense observation of light and dark and minute colour variation which makes each painting completely unique.

Karenina, renowned for her organic artworks of delicate beauty, is an artist of Italian descent who now lives and works in Barcelona. In this delightful interview she discusses some of the most important influences behind her work.“Can you highlight for our Manchester collectors what inspires your creativty?” “The key things that inspire me are the relationship between people and nature, but you never know when you will have a new idea for a painting: sometimes it comes when you are in a beautiful garden having tea or reading a book, sometimes when you are on the tube at rush hour, watching people’s faces, their expressions, if they are worried, happy or sad… or simply while I am in my studio.” "Why is nature such a key feature in your painting?” “Our world is organic, full of energy, in constant change and movement; nothing is fixed for eternity, everything moves and transform into something else, and nature is the best example of this. It is both fragile and extremely powerful at the same time. Life itself intrigues and fascinates me; the idea of birth and death… how complex, how fragile this is, and how people choose to use this limited time to live their lives.I like to compare people with this idea of pure natural fragility and unlimited power, like flowers, this beauty is sometimes intoxicating, it is always ephemeral, it is the cycle of life; terrifying and exquisite at the same time. In my work I like to catch this beauty, like a moment suspended in time.” “How do you develop your practise?”“For me becoming a painter was clear from the very beginning.As a child I came from a very dysfunctional family.  I drew to create my own personal world, using this time to escape reality.  Painting was always my shelter, my happy place, home if you like. I have also always loved literature, it has this power of taking you to another time and place in a second, and when you read something that was written three hundred years ago it could be that everything is different, their clothes, their hair, that they used carriages instead of cars… this is what I call “the stage”, but the soul of the people, their problems their suffering and their joy was always the same, and this is what I want to capture in my paintings, the essence of human nature.” ','N/A',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'Old Granada Studios, Quay Street M3 4PR Manchester',NULL,0,53.4783363,'Old Granada Studios, Quay Street M3 4PR Manchester',-2.2573991,'Tuesday – Friday: 11:00 – 17:00, Saturday: 11:00 – 17:00, Sunday and Monday by appointment only',NULL,'');

insert into venue values (NULL,'In collaboration with UK/Belgium-based artist Tiago Duarte, Castlefield Gallery is inviting Belgium-based artists Joke Van den Heuvel, Vijai Patchineelam, Adrien Tirtiaux and Floris Vanhoof to exhibit existing, new and site-specific work. Diagonal Noise will also include a reading area displaying publications by Posture Editions (Ghent, Belgium) and the exhibiting artists, alongside publications by artists and organisations based in and around Greater Manchester. Diverse subjects and disciplines inform the practices of the exhibiting artists. Considering the effect technology has on the formal qualities of contemporary art, Duarte looks for recurrent patterns in the mechanics of production. Though these patterns may manifest inherent malfunctions or misappropriation of media, they form the basis for the continuation of erratic and repetitious exercises. Like Duarte, Vanhoof investigates technology, particularly formats whose days may be numbered, experimenting with analogue technologies that used to be known as ‘high-tech’ alongside contemporary digital technology. Technology is not an end in itself, but a means for poetically exploring images, ideas and sound with works that often begin as live performances. Sudden Shifts (2012) by Patchineelam was filmed in Jardim Canadá, Brazil, a small rural town which has seen radical industrialisation in the last decade. Static camera positions, montage and abrupt cuts continually reorganise durational still lifes of industrial objects and abandoned furniture, pressing at the boundary between narrative and non-narrative relations to image and site.Van den Heuval is also interested in narratives produced by the barely perceptible, acknowledging that the meaning of images cannot be contained by language. Recordings of repetitive actions and monotonous characters in looping scenes blur the observer’s focus, inducing a kind of blindness towards the object – a blindness that makes seeing possible again. Tirtiaux deals with the specific characteristics of exhibition and public spaces, creating architectural interventions or large-scale sculpture informed by a careful examination of the given context in which he acts and works, drawing on the strategies of 70s conceptual art and the direct pictorial language of comic art. Diagonal Noise will coincide with the EU referendum and as Thursday 23 June approaches the UK public are being asked to consider their relationship with the European Union in the context of politicised maybes. This could be an interesting coincidence, but this exhibition leans more towards causality than chance. In places the works in Diagonal Noise are intrusive, forcing or slipping their way into one another, presenting states of dis-encounter, contingent proposals below the watermark of comprehension, of what might have been or might yet be. More on the artists: Tiago Duarte b. 1979, lives and works between Edinburgh, Manchester and Antwerp. Duarte has a Master of Research in Arts and Design from Sint Lucas University College of Art and Design, Antwerp, Belgium and a Master of Art from the Manchester School of Art, UK. Tiago’s practice is constrained by the derivatives of process such as repetition, differentiation and variation, revolving around the appropriation of technologies and its procedures. He reflects on how these technologies affect the formal qualities of contemporary art. By identifying recurrent patterns in the mechanics of production, even if these patterns manifest an inherent malfunction or misappropriation of the mediums and techniques, he finds the basis for the continuation of erratic exercises.

They cannot answer questions about their circumstances or intention; we have to /or can put these words into their mouths ourselves.

Vanhoof is interested in the hybrid forms of music, photo and film. He frequently makes performances with live sound and visuals which form the starting points for gallery installations. His first projections were 16mm celluloid experimental films which evolved into pure visual experiences in which he considered human viewing patterns. His work is rooted in structural film and early electronic music. Vanhoof creates his own instruments and installations which often explore the grey area between image (film or slides) and light (projection). As a media-archaeologist, Vanhoof confronts the contemporary digital intruder with flickering 16mm films and slide installations, formats whose days may be numbered. He deliberately choses analogue technology, not for nostalgic reasons, but because he wants to experiment with what used to be known as ‘high-tech’. His work also consists of new technologies such as microprocessors, though he considers technology not to be an end in itself but a means for poetically exploring images, ideas and sound. He recently exhibited at Beurssc50uwburg, Brussels (2015); Kunstencentrum België, Hasselt (2013); Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens, Deurle (2013). In 2015 he won the ING Public Prize, Young Belgian Art Prize. www.endlesswebsite.blogspot.co.uk Diagonal Noise has received additional support from Flanders Department for Culture, Youth, Sports and Media. - See more at:  http://www.castlefieldgallery.co.uk/event/diagonal-noise/#sthash.9f7VyFZU.dpuf ','Diagonal Noise',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'2 Hewitt Street M15 4GB Manchester',NULL,0,53.473843,'2 Hewitt Street M15 4GB Manchester',-2.2520979,'Wednesday - Sunday: 13:00 - 18:00',NULL,'');
insert into venue values (NULL,'Liverpool Biennial 2016 unfolds throughout the landscape of the city. It is organised as a story narrated in several episodes: Ancient Greece, Chinatown, Children, Monuments from the Future, Software and Flashback. Open Eye Gallery’s exhibition as part of Liverpool Biennial 2016 has a particular focus on the Flashback and Children’s episodes and features international artists Koki Tanaka (b. 1975, Tochigi, Japan), Fabien Giraud (b. 1980, Paris, France) and Raphaël Siboni (b. 1981, Paris, France), and Ana Jotta (b. 1946, Lisbon, Portugal). The Flashback episode presents a way of experiencing history as it punctures the present, unexpectedly. The Children’s episode invites artists to consider children as the primary audience, making work with and for them. Koki Tanaka’s diverse art practice spans video, photography, site-specific installation, and interventional projects. For Open Eye Gallery, Koki Tanaka revisits the scene of a huge protest in Liverpool (1985) that involved around 10,000 children, all of whom were angered by the Conservative government’s Youth Training Scheme (YTS). The scheme was intended to reduce unemployment amongst young people, which was 80% at the time, but instead it was used as a way to provide cheap labour. In May 2016, Tanaka will bring together the original participants and their children for a walk through the city, from the Town Hall to the Pier Head (where Open Eye Gallery is located) re-tracing the original route, whilst the group talk about the past and the future. Children will interview adults, and vice versa. The resulting film will be shown at Open Eye Gallery throughout the Biennial. Fabien Giraud and Raphaël Siboni’s collaborative work reflects on cinema history, philosophy and technological evolution. La Vallée Von Uexküll is the third in a series of films that respond to a strict protocol. In this film the sunset is filmed with a video camera but without any lens. Every time progress is made in image resolution and a new camera brought to the market, the film is shot once again. The artists will finish this film series once the resolution of the image surpasses the capacity of human perception – when the ‘eye’ of the camera can see more than the human ‘eye’. Ana Jotta’s work always includes an erasure: of her own previous footsteps; of modernist ideology and post-mortem mythologies; and of the notion of authorship – either by deconstructing it or rebuilding it. Inspired by the magic of cinema and of being sat in front of a screen where any story can unfold, Jotta presents a series of paintings that use projection screens as their canvas. Liverpool Biennial 2016, a free festival of newly commissioned contemporary art from around the world, takes place across the city’s galleries, unused buildings, public spaces and online from 9 July until 16 October. Further works from the Software and Flashback episodes, thematically linked to the exhibition at Open Eye Gallery, can be seen in venues including FACT, Bluecoat and The Oratory.','Liverpool Biennial 2016',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'19 Mann Island Liverpool Waterfront L3 1BP Liverpool ',NULL,0,53.4037241,'19 Mann Island Liverpool Waterfront L3 1BP Liverpool ',-2.9957639,'Tuesday - Sunday: 10:30 - 17:30 ',NULL,'');

insert into venue values (NULL,'Glasgow Sculpture Studios presents a solo exhibition of new work by Katie Schwab, developed throughout her one year Graduate Fellowship at GSS from November 2015 until November 2016. Schwab is interested in the politics of constructing and inhabiting living space: how the building, designing, furnishing and upkeep of rooms can reveal the values, economies and politics of the people that live there. She is particularly interested in communal living situations, and how an individual voice might be found within the context of a shared living space. Her work is multi-disciplinary and combines various forms of craft and fine art including video, text, tapestry, embroidery, ceramics and functional furniture embracing both contemporary technological making processes, and traditional craft techniques. Her works are often choreographed together in installations in a ‘communal’ exhibition space. Her installations combine objects that embrace both contemporary technological innovation and traditional craft processes (e.g.  apestry- weaving, wood turning). The work she makes stems from an interest in 19th, 20th and 21st century domestic design and social living space. She is particularly interested in the furniture, architecture and home-ware of communities who believed in the importance, whether social, religious or political, of design and craft in everyday life. Recent work has explored the objects and living spaces of 1960s leftists, the Bauhaus, the Shakers and present day communes. Katie Schwab received her MFA from the Glasgow School of Art in 2015 and has exhibited at the Voidoidarchive, Glasgow; Cookhouse Gallery, Chelsea College of Art and Design, London; Temporary Agency, New York; Airspace Gallery, Stoke-On-Trent; Jerwood Visual Arts Project Space, London; Limazulu, London & Kaus Australis, Rotterdam.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Glasgow Sculpture Studios has invited Polish artist Zofia Kulik (b. 1947) to present her significant—yet relatively unknown—project Instead of Sculpture 1968–71. This will be the first solo exhibition of the artist’s work in a UK institution, and the first time that GSS have presented an historic work as part of its programme.  Kulik’s project, first shown as her degree exhibition at the Department of Sculpture at the Academy of Fine Art, Warsaw in 1971, presented radical thinking about the intersection of film and sculpture, proposing a reinvention of the sculptural medium. The work consists of serialised photographic works that are grouped as narrative tableaux, rather than chronologically. This work has been shown once, and only partially, since its original presentation, yet it remains historically significant, and enduring in asking questions around the relationship between sculpture, film and documentation, still pertinent in discussions today. Zofia Kulik (b. 1947, Wrocław, Poland) lives and works in Warsaw (Łomianki). From 1965 to 1971, she studied at the Sculpture Department of the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. After her graduation, Zofia Kulik and Przemysław Kwiek formed the artistic duo KwieKulik, a project which lasted until 1987 and was one of the most important groups of the Polish neo-avant-garde. They carried through countless performances, interventions and artistic demonstrations, as well as creating objects, films and photographs. In their private apartment in Warsaw, the duo set up an independent gallery called the Studio of Activities, Documentation and Propagation (PDDiU), in the frame of which an archive of polish art from the 70s and 80s was created. Since 1987, Zofia Kulik has been working individually, creating black-and-white multiple exposure photographs, objects, installations and films.

Detailed explanations on the back of the works declare that her hand was guided by various spirits, including several Renaissance artists, as well as higher angelic beings. In this exhibition The Courtauld Galley explores this stounding series of largely abstract Victorian watercolours and offers visitors a unique opportunity to view remarkable works which have not been shown in the UK for nearly 150 years. 
Houghton was a prominent figure of the early spiritualist movement in Victorian England, which played a significant role in various spheres of nineteenth-century culture and was later championed by such influential figures as Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Spiritualism emerged as the belief that contact with a spirit realm was possible and that such communication could bring one closer to God. Houghton, a trained artist as well as a medium, pioneered the use of drawing as a method of channelling and expressing communications with spirit entities. During the 1860s and 1870s, she produced a series of unprecedented abstract watercolours as part of her practice as a spirit medium. Houghton called these works ‘spirit drawings’. Houghton’s spirit drawings are remarkably complex and layered watercolours. Technically highly accomplished, their bold colours and fluid forms have a mesmerising and deeply absorbing effect. Detailed inscriptions on the back of the works declare that her hand was guided by various spirits, including family members, several Renaissance artists, such as Titian and Correggio and higher angelic beings. These inscriptions, which are a form of automatic writing, also make clear that Houghton’s richly patterned compositions are intended to be faithful visualisations of aspects of the spirit realm and designed to inspire and strengthen the spiritual life of their viewers. Although produced in a very different context, Houghton’s abstract works have close connections to the ways in which twentieth- century artists developed abstract languages of art to transcend the everyday realm of representation and consciousness. In 1871 Houghton rented a prestigious gallery space in Bond Street and presented 155 of her spirit drawings to a perplexed London audience. The Critic from The Era newspaper pronounced it to be “The most astonishing exhibition in London at the present moment.” The Daily News likened the works to “tangled threads of coloured wool” and concluded that “They deserve to be seen as the most extraordinary and instructive example of artistic aberration.” The exhibition proved to be a commercial failure and nearly bankrupted Houghton. Although she continued to make spirit drawings after the exhibition, her ambition of popularising the practice was not realised. Today, less than fifty of her works are known.

But, intriguingly, almost from the beginning, individual trees have been the subject of close study in their own right. In many cases they serve as a means for artists to develop their powers of observation and manual dexterity as well as a tool for constructing larger landscapes.Whether studied directly from nature or conjured from the artist’s imagination, whether loaded with poetic or political symbolism or addressed in a down-to-earth, factual manner, artists through the ages have treated trees with the same reverence and psychological insight as a portraitist would accord a sitter.This display of drawings, drawn from The Courtauld Gallery’s collection, explores artists’ enduring fascination with the tree. Ranging from the early sixteenth to the mid nineteenth centuries and including works by Fra Bartolommeo, Jan van Goyen, Claude Lorrain and John Constable, among others, it takes the framework of Gilpin’s treatise as its starting point, moving from portraits of individual trees to depictions of trees within landscapes and concluding with a selection of forest scenes. Together, they offer an insight into some of the many roles trees have played over the centuries.','Regarding Trees',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'Somerset House WC2R 0RN London',NULL,0,51.5107324,'Somerset House WC2R 0RN London',-0.116937699999994,'Monday - Friday : 10:00 - 18:00',NULL,'');

Presented alongside sculptures and textile works by Nilbar Güres and Candice Lin and Patrick Staff that explore gendered forms of cultural assimilation and societal expectation, these works compose rhythms of desire, empathy and belonging that are, to an extent, ‘out of time’ and which question how identities are constructed and held captive by periodisation.A Kingdom of Hours is indebted to American queer theorist Elizabeth Freeman’s writings on ‘chrononormativity’ – a process of standardisation through which societies’ rhythms are internalised by their constituents like city smog – and ‘erotohistoriography’, or a deeply affective approach to history rooted in desire. Bringing together artists from different generations and cultural backgrounds, the exhibition considers the biopolitical implications of these concepts and other ‘chronodissident’ strategies and forms.A Kingdom of Hours is curated by Robert Leckie (Curator, Gasworks) and Miguel A.

His modest resources shaped his DIY approach and led him to incorporate found objects as a foundation for making his adornments; early creations questioned established material hierarchies and were testimony to the harsh realities of industrial and economic decline. It was during this period that he encountered a range of creative individuals including Derek Jarman, Anthony Price, John Maybury and Leigh Bowery who championed his inventive approach to making fashion accessories.In 1985 Blame helped John Moore to set up The House of Beauty and Culture in Dalston, London, a craft collective of like-minded artists including Fiona Skinner, Dave Baby, Fiona Bowen, John Flett, Peter Foster, Mark Lebon, Alan Macdonald & Fritz Solomon (Fric & Frack), Richard Torry and Christopher Nemeth. This collective experience proved to be the first of many important collaborations as a consultant with various designers including John Galliano, Rifat Ozbek, Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garçons, Gareth Pugh, Marc Jacobs and Kim Jones at Louis Vuitton.A further significant figure in Blame’s continued growth as a creative polymath was Ray Petri, nexus of the pseudo-corporate fashion collective Buffalo, who encouraged him to focus his talents as a fashion stylist. Blame was soon producing iconic fashion editorials with a range of photographers including Mark Lebon, Mark Mattock, Jean Baptiste Mondino and Juergen Teller for publications such as i-D, BLITZ and The Face. His instinctive ability to create symbolic images that embodied radical elements of popular culture and fashion led to an extensive career in the music industry as an art director and image consultant for iconic figures such as Boy George, Neneh Cherry, Kylie Minogue, Massive Attack and Bjork.Judy Blame in conversation with Gregor Muir FULL INTERVIEWVideo of Judy Blame in conversation with Gregor Muir FULL INTERVIEW Throughout his career Blame has maintained his artistic foundation, making jewellery from found and re-purposed objects.

This term, coined in the 1980s, reflects the musical and social influences that informed early experiments in merging the sounds of synth-pop and disco with funk to create this distinct music genre.For the first time in the UK, this exhibition charts a timeline of Detroit Techno music from its 1970s origins, continuing through to the early 1990s. The genre has its origins in the disco parties of Ken Collier with influence from local radio stations and DJs, such as Electrifying Mojo and The Wizard (aka Jeff Mills).  It explores how a generation was inspired to create a new kind of electronic music that was evidenced in the formative UK compilation Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit (10 Records, 1988). Using inexpensive analogue technology such as the Roland TR-808 and 909, DJs and producers including Juan Atkins, Blake Baxter, Eddie Fowlkes, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson formed this seminal music genre.Although the music failed to gain mainstream audiences in the US, it became a phenomenon in Europe. This success established Detroit Techno as a new strand of music which absorbed European tastes and influences. This introduced a second wave of DJs and producers to the sound including Carl Craig, Richie Hawtin and Kenny Larkin.The display concludes with a focus on Underground Resistance, a collection of DJs and artists including Mike Banks, John Collins, Robert Hood and Jeff Mills (until his departure in 1992). Their collective ambition was to challenge the commercial mainstream entertainment industry and re-establish Detroit techno music’s authenticity with an emphasis on the city as a source of inspiration.To accompany the exhibition the ICA presents a season of online programmes featuring Detroit artists from the past and present on NTS Radio.The ICA Fox Reading Room was made possible by the generous support of the Edwin Fox Foundation.','Detroit: Techno City',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'12 Carlton House Terrace SW1Y 5AH London',NULL,0,51.5066303,'12 Carlton House Terrace SW1Y 5AH London',-0.13033519999999,'Wednesday : 12:00 - 23:00, Thursday - Saturday : 12:00 - 1:00, Sunday : 12:00 - 21:00',NULL,'');

insert into venue values (NULL,'This autumn, Somerset House is proud to present Hair by Sam McKnight, a major exhibition celebrating the master hairstylist’s remarkable 40 year career, from the late 1970s to the current day. An integral part of the fashion industry, Sam has been instrumental in helping to develop the images of Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell and Princess Diana among many others. He is one of the first session stylists to have carved out a career solely within fashion, having worked on hundreds of fashion editorial shoots, advertising campaigns and catwalk shows. He has shot over 100 covers for British Vogue alone, as well as numerous other magazines and worked with most international fashion designers from Chanel to Vivienne Westwood. The exhibition will unveil the little-known creative process behind the craft of hair styling within fashion and explore the relationships between McKnight and key, long-term collaborators; photographers such as Nick Knight and Patrick Demarchelier, models including Kate Moss, Stella Tennant and Christy Turlington, stylist Lucinda Chambers, and designer Karl Lagerfeld. This will be the first exhibition of its kind, looking at hair from a new perspective and contextualising its wider cultural significance and the role of the session stylist within fashion. It will include some of the most iconic images in popular culture and some of fashion’s most memorable looks, from Princess Diana’s short, slicked back style to Madonna’s Bedtime Stories, and Tilda Swinton channelling David Bowie, tracing different movements and hairstyles, from nostalgic to androgynous, romantic to sexy, red to platinum, cataloguing the transformative nature of hair within the image. Exhibiting pieces from Sam’s extensive archive, gathered over his 40 year career, the exhibition will feature photography, magazines, catwalk and behind-the-scenes footage, private photographs and full outfit looks as well as commissioned wigs and hairpieces. Grouped into thematic sections, the exhibition will explore process, relationships and collaboration, movement, transformation, the shoot and the catwalk. Throughout the exhibition a visual timeline will trace not only Sam’s career from the late 1970s to today, but also track changing styles through time; exploring the relationship between fashion shoots and the street in influencing contemporary hair styling. To be published at the same time as the exhibition, there will be a book by the same name, Hair by Sam McKnight with texts by Tim Blanks, Alexander Fury, Amanda Harlech, Nick Knight, Camilla Morton, Anna-Marie Solowij, Jerry Stafford and commentary by Sam McKnight featuring images spanning his entire career. Richly illustrated, it features photographs by leading fashion photographers and styles commissioned by Vivienne Westwood, Balmain, Chanel, and many others.  A unique reference book that offers a glamorous tour through the past forty years and a style bible for glorious looks, the book is published by Rizzoli and priced at £35.00.  The exhibition is curated by Shonagh Marshall and exhibition design is by Michael Howells.

insert into venue values (NULL,'This summer, Studio Voltaire will present a retrospective of the 1980’s performance group the Neo Naturists. This will be the first historical survey of the Neo Naturists work in a public institution. The Neo Naturists were an important live art collective initiated in 1981 by Jennifer Binnie, Christine Binnie and Wilma Johnson. The group emerged as a part of London’s subculture that arose from the squatting community in the aftermath of Punk and the emergence of the New Romantic club scene and the advent of Thatcherism. During this time a creative energy developed in the UK that sat outside established institutional practices of the time, creating its own network of activities, events, economies and personalities. The Neo Naturists were a part of an incredible cultural network of collaborators and peers that included significant figures such as BodyMap (Stevie Stewart & David Holah), Leigh Bowery, Michael Clark, Peter Doig, Boy George, John Maybury, Bruce Lacey, Andrew Logan, Grayson Perry, Derek Jarman, Princess Julia, Peter Robinson (Marilyn), Test Department and Cerith Wyn Evans. Combining ideas of ancient rituals with contemporary life, The Neo Naturists performed wearing little more than body paint in nightclubs, galleries, festivals and at unannounced site-specific public performances. Their celebration of a particular kind of anarchic innocence and deliberate primitivism provided a unique artistic voice within a cultural landscape that was otherwise dominated by a male perspective. Accordingly, their work engages with a range of complex issues surrounding gender, representation and performance. The retrospective at Studio Voltaire will focus on elements taken from their archive from 1980–1992 and will include video footage of original performances, photographic documentation, costumes, paintings and ephemera from their performances.This project will not follow the archetypal archive exhibition format, instead Studio Voltaire will stage a live archive exhibition. During the run up to the exhibition, the three original members of the group will work in-residency in the gallery, body printing and painting directly onto the gallery walls. An integral aspect of the retrospective will be the re-staging of key performances. During the exhibition’s run, The Neo Naturists will takeover the theatre space at the ICA for a night of immersive performance, film and music.

insert into venue values (NULL,'The Ethics of Dust is a temporary site-specific artwork made for Westminster Hall, the oldest building on the Parliamentary Estate and home to the UK’s House of Commons and House of Lords. Created by artist, architect and conservationist Jorge Otero-Pailos, the work is a 50 metre long translucent latex cast of the hall’s east wall, containing hundreds of years of surface pollution and dust. Suspended from the hall’s 28 metre high hammer beam roof, the latex contains innumerable particles of dust, soot and dirt gently lifted from the wall, a special method developed for the cleaning of this UNESCO world heritage site. Otero-Pailos has previously made casts of the walls of other heritage monuments including the 14th century Doge’s Palace in Venice at the 53rd Venice Biennale in 2009. Westminster Hall and the Doge’s Palace share a history that runs deep in the British and European cultural consciousness: both were seats of governments ruling vast naval empires, threatened with demolition by over-enthusiastic classical architects (Andrea Palladio and Sir John Soane), and ultimately saved by restorations in the original Gothic style. The Ethics of Dust takes its name from Victorian writer and social thinker John Ruskin’s 1908 publication The Ethics of The Dust. Ruskin’s great admiration for these two Gothic structures led him to lay the intellectual foundations of modern conservation. Anticipating concerns over pollution, he recognised its damaging effects on buildings, but argued against surface cleaning, fearing 19th century architects would do more damage than good with the blunt instruments available to them at the time. Conservation technology has now advanced to the point where cleaning can be safely and sensitively carried out without damaging the stone.

insert into venue values (NULL,'As part of the Power and Architecture season, new and existing work by artists from across the New East region will be exhibited over four interconnected installments. Multiple facets of architecture’s relationship to power will be presented, from artistic reflections on the modernist vision of the socialist city to the individual’s participation in the activation of public space and the afterlife of cities built for a utopia that was never realised. Part 1: Utopia and Modernity 12 June — 3 July 2016 In the opening show, four artists will reflect on the modernist vision of the socialist city and consider the real and imagined futures of utopia. Polish-born, Berlin-based Przemek Pyszczek’s series Façade captures the bright, block-colour decorative Soviet-era design of external walls and window grates. Dmitry Lookianov’s Instant Tomorrow series provides a vision of the near future through the setting of Muscovite apartment life, where minimalistic furniture and repetitious architecture create a suburban “utopia”. In his films Hyperborea and Walking the Sea, Anton Ginzburg explores the quest for a perfect, utopian life and its potentially devastating impact. Kuba Snopek, Iza Cichońska and Karolina Popera’s Architecture of the VII Day catalogue draws upon 3,597 churches built by hand in Poland against the will of the state in the second half of the 20th Century and the circumstances of their construction. Participating artists: Przemek Pyszczek, Dmitry Lookianov, Anton Ginzburg, Kuba Snopek, Iza Cichońska and Karolina Popera.  Part 2: Dead space and ruins 7 July – 7 August 2016 Three photographers present the decaying architectural reminiscence of the Soviet vision. With work taking inspiration from across the vast landscape of the former Soviet Union, these artists will explore the “dead space” left in the wake of the quest for progress. Eric Lusito maps what remained of the militaristic power of the USSR from eastern Europe to eastern Siberia. His photographic series Traces of the Soviet Empire catalogues the haunting ruins of former bases, monuments and equipment from length and breadth of the empire. In Restricted Areas, Danila Tkachenko presents us with the “utopian strive of humans for technological progress”[1]. The artist travelled to sites embodying this quest for advancement, not found on any map or travel guide; these behemoths lie forgotten and decomposing in the frozen tundra. Turo by Anton Ginzburg investigates post-Soviet geography and icons of constructivist architecture. The four chapters of the film explore different landmarks of Soviet modernism such as the Narkomfin building and ZIL, while proposing alternate futures for these and other settings through virtual, video game-like environments. Vahram Aghasyan reminds us of the many examples of deserted urban areas across the Soviet Empire. Through economic meltdown, natural disaster or industrial catastrophe, Ghost City references the disregarded buildings that used to form towns in parts of the vast Soviet landscape. Part 3: Citizen activated space — Museum of Skateboarding 11 August – 11 September 2016  Part three is a new commission by Calvert 22 Foundation that will explore the individual’s participation in the activation of public space with Russian artist Kirill Savchenkov’s installation. Museum of Skateboarding is a mixed media installation that considers skateboarding not just as a form of exercise, but also as a visceral way to explore and reflect on the post-Soviet residential suburbs of Moscow. The project studies the secret language of the sport, illustrating how certain architectural interventions or objects can be understood through skateboarding. Part 4: The afterlives of Modernity — shared values and routines  15 September – 9 October 2016  The season culminates with four artists considering the afterlives of utopian endeavour and the quest for new national identities. Across the former Soviet Union there are a series of architectural and physical nostalgias connecting citizens who share the same socialist history – part four of the programme reflects on these shared values and routines for citizens today. Aikaterini Gegesian’s film My Pink City offers a portrait of a post-Soviet Yeravan adapting to the transition. The film depicts the militarisation of public space and the gendered divisions within the city. With the Russian-backed war in eastern Ukraine, the country’s government has responded with laws designed to rid Ukraine’s public spaces of communist relics. Their destruction proclaims a deep desire to change the cultural narrative. Monumental Propaganda is a series by Donald Weber documenting the sites these monuments stood on and the empty pedestals that remain today.  For Dmytrij Wulffius’ series, Traces on Concrete, the artist photographed his hometown of Yalta in Crimea. The series is an exploration of the utopian architectural landscape of the post-Soviet world but from the perspective of modern youth. All images from this series were taken between 2009 and 2013.  Re:centering Periphery: Post Socialist Triplicities by Ogino Knauss documents the post-socialist backgrounds of Berlin, Belgrade and Moscow, exploring what is left of the architectural vision in the cities and what this legacy has left citizens.

Although these elements may share no meaningful connection, the imagination of the viewers spins them into ‘Unexpected Stories’. Through their unconventional juxtaposition, mundane and commonplace scenes from the everyday world morph from reality to surreality. Reclassifying the relationships between multiple events and motifs, the viewer can open the door  to infinite possibilities. The artworks in this exhibition were inspired by the artist’s European experience since 2014, exemplified by the buzzing atmosphere of a Berlin café with vintage chairs and tables. Kumano’s sense of density and scale brings the viewers into a delicate atmosphere of joy and pale gloom, where the unpredictability of the artist’s narrative will surprise them. Umi Kumano (b. Fukui, 1983) graduated from Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 2007. He is the recipient of the Shell Art Award (2010), Iemura Tamayo Shinsain Award (2010), Tokyo Wonderwall Award (2010), Wonderseed (shortlisted, 2012) and  the 16th Okamoto Taro Contemporary Art Award (2013).

Afterparty 9–11PM with DJ sets by Goth Tech and Juliana Huxtable. Limited places  Curators’ Tours: Sat 4 Jun & Sat 23 Jul, 4pm For the ninth edition of the Curators’ Series, DRAF invites Arcadia Missa, a self-organised space in South East London, founded in 2011. The exhibition Ways of Living engages artists who occupy and transform spaces; with both emerging and historical artists including Hannah Black, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jesse Darling, Sharon Hayes, Eva Hesse, Jenny Holzer, Peter Hujar, Juliana Huxtable, Anne Imhof, Beatrice Loft Schulz, Adrian Piper, Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings, Paul Thek, Lena Tutunjian and Holly White. This exhibition looks at artists who have sought practices inverse to the individualised, satellite modes in which we are increasingly expected to work, using materials and situations contingent to the places they live, no matter how internationally connected they themselves may be. In doing so, these artists actualise, imagine or politicise the spaces in which they find themselves; fostering a still-needed sense of locality and producing directed responses to problems definitive of their time, place and situation. Artworks that speak about society outside of the gallery are not new; nor is the model of the process, rather than the product, as art. A processual and collaborative way of working as a fallout of socio-political austerity also has historical precursors. Thus, this exhibition presents new commissions alongside twentieth century works from the David Roberts Collection or on loan to draw parallels as to how the residue, the material of the artwork itself, can exist potently after the act from which it was born. “Ways of Living focuses on artwork that is directly geared to be within, or part of, the society and relationships in which the artist lives. It presents material that seeps out from the immediate and generative ways of working of a range of artists – works that are somehow performances, or documentations of performances. The works often subvert or cast a spotlight on the institutionalisation of power. Bluntly, we could say this show is about process-as-artwork, and many of these processes involve negotiation and agency – a reality of, or definition of, or even possibly alternative to, the term ‘collaboration’. We are interested in what documentation is, and how it can operate as a half-life: much of this exhibition explores how a process remains, how the work is an act in its own right, and how something so visceral can still speak to us when taken out of the specific context of its making. Many of the artists in the show are artists connected to Arcadia Missa in some way: this self-organised nepotism functions as a transportation of the space created between us and our peers, but it is of course transformed rather than simply transplaced. This is why it is important for us to think about what space is. On the one hand, Arcadia Missa is a physical meeting point/production and exhibition space/publishers in a precariously-rented railway arch. Yet what has urged and inspired us is the space created through conversations with those close to us: conversations which have opened outwards, sometimes forcibly inserting themselves into a another place, sometimes picked up with or without the mouths that have voiced and willed a discourse into being. This is why thinking about artworks as containing an act, a thought, from elsewhere, or being performances themselves, is key. This show continues an ongoing conversation, or battle, around how representations can work, how they can continue a critique when removed from their site of origin. Working with older artists we admire as well as works separated from their artists to reside in a collection helps us to think about this, and to learn from those who have been negotiating the terms on which artworks operate since before we existed.” Arcadia Missa, 2016 Live events as part of the project include performances by Beatrice Loft Schulz, DJ sets by Goth Tech (Holly White and Josh Grigg) and Juliana Huxtable; a week-long residency and performance event by artist duo @Gaybar (Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings); a book launch event by Holly White, and Curators’ tours by Arcadia Missa. Arcadia Missa is a self-organised space founded in 2011 in Peckham, South East London. It combines independent research and curatorial projects, exhibition space and publications platform. It has presented off-site projects at international institutions including Astrup Fearnley Museet (Oslo), South London Gallery (London), 55 Sydenham Road (Sydney) and Tank TV (London and online). The journal How To Sleep Faster, which combines creative writing with critical theory and commentary, is now in its seventh edition. Arcadia Missa is run by Founding Director and Curator Rozsa Farkas (b. 1987, UK) and Director Zhoe Granger (b.1988, New Zealand). DRAF Curators’ Series supports independent curators by commissioning special research-based projects, considering the curator as an author.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Streams of Warm Impermanence is a group exhibition at DRAF (David Roberts Art Foundation) of artworks that embody new iterations of flesh in a networked era. The body has been inscribed and interpreted, naturalised and modified (via cosmetics, genetics, medicine, photoshop, etc), radicalised, objectified, politicised, sexualised, reconquered and annihilated, glorified and denied. Streams of Warm Impermanence shifts from body to flesh and looks beyond well-rehearsed anxieties about human corporeity rendered either excluded and redundant, or abstracted and vacuous, by the digital era; to empowered bodies operating through the network to perform, transform, transcribe, reconfigure or reinvent. Streams of Warm Impermanence looks at artworks that articulate a vision of flesh as a material and a locus of fluid identity full of potential. The artists in this exhibition work with ‘Networked-Flesh’, which infiltrates and is informed by the systems around it: these bodies are both subjects and objects. They expand and circulate beyond their human-envelopes, troubling their materiality. Neither static and solid nor fully fluid, they approach a condition of Sublimation (a term from Physics for a direct transition from solid to gas). As they infect, pollinate or mutate through networks, all bodies have the potential to be “trans-” in its literal meaning: across, through, beyond. The exhibition includes sculptures, paintings, drawings, environments, performances and video works never previously presented in London as well as new commissions. Practices by international contemporary artists are accompanied by historical works that point to key moments of shift in artists’ engagement with the body. The exhibition is curated and produced by Vincent Honoré (Director/Chief Curator) with Nicoletta Lambertucci (Curator), Cedric Fauq and Callum Kirkbride (Curatorial Assistants).','Streams of warm impermanence',1,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,'Symes Mews NW1 7JE London',NULL,0,51.5350187,'Symes Mews NW1 7JE London',-0.139323099999956,'Thursday - Saturday : 12:00 - 18:00, Tuesday - Wednesday : by appointment',NULL,'');
insert into venue values (NULL,'Delfina Foundation is delighted to present an exhibition of new work by Canadian artist, Jean-Paul Kelly. Exploring the relationship between materiality and perception, Kelly creates videos, drawings, and photographs that pose questions about the limits of representation by examining complex associations between found photographs, videos, and sounds from documentaries, photojournalism, and online media streams. By working through these documents, Kelly seeks to illuminate the gap between physical matter and the subjective experience of it in the world. In this new installation, That ends that matter, Kelly questions a documentary practice that takes place in UK courtrooms through a three-channel video, works on paper and sculpture. In early 2015, while in residence at Delfina Foundation, Kelly attended City of London Magistrates’ Court in Central London for eight weeks as a visitor, during which time he observed the daily events in one courtroom. The UK’s Criminal Justice Act forbids all recording and sketching in court, allowing illustrators to only take notes; Kelly instrumentalises this restricted form of recounting as both a structural and poetic device for his work. In a world of ubiquitous image production and ready access to information, these courts of law are peculiar places. They force representations to be made on the basis of abstract observation and memory, generating images that are constituted by the contradictions of being shared and personal. In That ends that matter, the eight-minute, three-channel video is constructed of a re-enactment of actual events which the artist witnessed in court; photographic material from online image streams used to retell the sensed experience of those events; and a visual music animation where geometric shapes copied from these re-enactments are drawn directly onto the optical soundtrack of 16mm film to produce a score. As Jean Paul Kelly explains: “The primary goal of my work is producing a fair account of my experience of the world. My inquiry is not related to redundant claims of indexical truth but rather to the repositioning of artifice, desire, and bias as the material source for realising the form of the work. That ends that matter is an attempt to document a certain form of subjective sense.” Jean-Paul Kelly Biography : Jean-Paul is a Canadian artist exploring the relationship between materiality and perception. His work has been exhibited at CGP London: Dilston Grove, Wexner Center for the Arts (Columbus), The Power Plant (Toronto), Vox Populi (Philadelphia), Scrap Metal Gallery (Toronto), Mercer Union (Toronto), Gallery TPW (Toronto).  He was a featured artist at the 2013 Robert Flaherty Film Seminar and a resident at Delfina Foundation (London, 2015) and the International Studio & Curatorial Program (New York, 2015-16). Kelly received the 2014 Kazuko Trust Award from the Kazuko Trust and the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the 2015 Images Festival Award.

Jerwood Solo Presentations will be the second of two new curatorial projects taking place in the gallery across July and August. It will follow on from the Jerwood Staging Series, a programme dedicated to event-based presentations including seminars, screenings and performances. Both will provide a crucial London platform to promising artists. Lucy Parker, Rachel Pimm and Katie Schwab were among a number of artists nominated by Jerwood Visual Arts’ former Writers in Residence, and were selected by Sarah Williams, Head of Programme, and Oliver Fuke, Gallery Manager. Each artist will have a solo presentation in one of the three galleries at Jerwood Space. Lucy Parker will be presenting new film work based on her in-depth research into the practice of ‘blacklisting’. Rachel Pimm will show a moving image installation relating to her studies into the proximity of plastics and water; Katie Schwab is producing a mixed-media installation piece inspired by the work of twentieth-century female printmakers. “Jerwood Solo Presentations provides a platform for artists to present a focussed new body of work, as well as offering developmental support. Lucy, Rachel and Katie have been selected for the quality of their work and are all at a crucial point in their thinking. It is a privilege to support three exceptional artists and the realisation of three distinct bodies of work.” Sarah Williams, Head of Programme, Jerwood Visual Arts. Jerwood Solo Presentation: Lucy Parker Lucy Parker, Blacklist (film still), 2015; Thom Walker, Drawing of a Blacklist Phantom, 2015. Courtesy the artist. Filmmaker Lucy Parker experiments with documentary filmmaking methods when making work with or about a community. Her research is concerned with ways that educational systems impact on individuals and groups. For her solo presentation, Lucy will develop a new film that explores the subject of the apology, questioning when an apology is meaningful and when it is given simply to ‘draw a line under’ an event, to avoid taking further action. This work is part of ongoing research towards a longer film, about the experiences of construction workers whose employers made use of a ‘blacklist’, which kept a record of an individual’s political activity at and outside of work. Since the files were discovered in 2009 the workers have been seeking justice. The workers have recently received compensation payments from firms however the significance of the ‘apology’ is tempered by the lack of legislative change and a criminal trial, and therefore by the threat that the practice of blacklisting will continue. Jerwood Solo Presentation: Rachel Pimm Rachel Pimm works across performance, sculpture and video, investigating the fluid concepts of \'naturalness’ and ‘artificialness\', in relation to subjects such as eco-design and water management. At Jerwood Space she will combine new work in video, photography and print to explore the conflicting environmental discourses surrounding plastics in bodies of water. Working on a variety of scales, Pimm will collate images relating to the use of plastic micro-beads in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, and images from government drought responses, including the deploying of millions of plastic spherical shade balls into the drinking water reservoirs of California to reduce evaporation and control ecology. The work will be installed in an environment evocative of a spa, with a central pool-style lightbox. The work is titled Aposiopesis (the rhetorical technique of suddenly stopping mid-sentence) - through its usage the artist reflects the uncertainty and instability of the ecological issues underlying her work. The spa setting\'s reassuring sense of security will create a tension with the critical, urgent environmental themes at play in Rachel’s work.

Courtesy the artist. Katie Schwab is interested in the politics of, and relationships between, craft, design, housing and education. Her artworks take the form of embroidered and woven textiles, ceramic tableware, functional furniture and videos, which are often grouped together in installations. She is interested in utilising traditional craft processes, small batch production methods and contemporary technology to explore questions around gender, labour and public and private space. For her solo presentation she will create a new installation of textile, furniture and video works drawing on the designs of twentieth-century female printmakers including Phyllis Barron, Dorothy Larcher, Enid Marx and the Footprints textiles workshop. Expanding on research from interviews, workshops and archives, these works will explore the abstract forms of block-printing in relation to areas of communal, social and educational space.

Rebecca Beinart, Magz Hall, Keith Harrison, David Rickard and David Turley will each receive a £2,000 research and development fee with which to expand on the concept of their proposals, test feasibility and explore potential sites within England’s Public Forest Estate. Each artist will benefit from a six-month research and development period and take part in a group exhibition in November at Jerwood Space, London. In addition to being supported by the teams at Jerwood Charitable Foundation and Forestry Commission England, they will attend a programme of developmental activities as a peer group including workshops and advisory sessions alongside one-to-one mentoring sessions. The artist selected for the commission will be announced towards the end of 2016. For this second edition of Jerwood Open Forest, artists from across the UK and within 15 years of beginning their practice were once more invited to submit bold, broad-thinking proposals that explore the potential of forests as a site for art. The initiative contributes to a national conversation about how contemporary visual artists engage with the environment today, and debates around critical practice and art in the public realm. ‘The Arts Council is thrilled to be supporting the second edition of the Jerwood Open Forest. It is a great model for commissioning considered and innovative new work, allowing emerging artists the space and time to test new ideas under the stewardship of Jerwood Charitable Foundation and Forestry Commission England. Through this partnership artists can access the unique and diverse Public Forest Estate in England, it is a wonderful way to increase access to and enjoyment of visual art across the country.’ Jo Baxendale, Relationship Manager Visual Arts, Arts Council England The selection has been made by leading practitioners and project partners: Katherine Clarke artist and founding partner of muf architecture/art; Neville Gabie artist; Shonagh Manson Director, Jerwood Charitable Foundation; Hayley Skipper National Arts Development Programme Manager, Forestry Commission England; Dr Joy Sleeman writer, curator and lecturer. ‘The range of imaginative approaches to forest environments represented by the five shortlisted artists is indicative of the rich inspiration such places inspire. The artists will each be embracing aspirations to bring new experiences into forests – whether by engaging with their human history, their relationship with their urban surroundings or through an intimate engagement with individual trees.’ Joy Sleeman, selector Selected Artists Rebecca Beinart will explore the relationship between care and loss through an ambitious piece of live work bringing together a collection of stories about lost trees, developed through research collected around specific forests. The audience will experience a series of one-to-one encounters, which draw upon connections between personal experiences of loss and wider themes such as deforestation and collective memory. Rebecca completed an MA in Arts and Ecology at Dartington School of Art (now part of Falmouth University) in 2008. Her projects, which are often collaborative, explore the crossover between art, ecology and politics, taking the form of live events and interventions in public places. Recent work includes a commission for the National Trust in Staffordshire, with Katy Beinart, entitled Imagined Geographies (2015), and Bureau of Urban Wilds, a commission for UP Projects in London (2013-14). axisweb.org/p/rebeccabeinart Sound and radio artist Magz Hall will develop an interactive trail of radio transmissions through the forest, playfully enabling trees to whisper to each other, and re-engaging with a sense of technological enchantment so intrinsic to the early radio experiments that make up much of her research interests. She envisages members of the public recording their own secrets and dreams into simple radio hardware disguised within a tree. Magz is a senior lecturer at Canterbury Christ Church University UK, and a founder of London’s arts radio station Resonance FM. Her audio work has been exhibited in the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, the British Museum, Tate Britain, and internationally. In 2015 she completed her PhD at CRISAP (Creative Research into Sound Arts Practice), University of the Arts London. magzhall.wordpress.com Keith Harrison proposes a multi-faceted performative sculpture bringing together industrial forces within the context of the forest, inspired by his upbringing in the heavily post-industrialized Black Country. Keith will explore constructing a series of mud jumps through the forest, working with BMXers; from the same mud he will build a prototype car to be launched from a monumental ramp as a public event. Keith is particularly fascinated by the potential for the direct physical transformation of clay from a raw state utilising industrial and domestic electrical systems in a series of time-based public experiments. He completed his MA in Ceramics and Glass at Royal College of Art, in 2002. From 2012 - 2013 he undertook a Ceramics Residency at the V&A Museum, and has exhibited widely, most recently at KARST, Plymouth, and at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff. keith-harrison.info David Rickard’s proposal Returnings, a vast forest installation built with timber collected from across the UK, will explore the cyclical journey of the forests’ trees. Each piece of ‘reclaimed’ wood will be imprinted with details of its previous function and location, thereby recording a network of the past lives of timber elements within the depths of their original environment. Rickard studied Architecture at the Auckland School of Architecture in New Zealand, before studying Fine Art at Brera Accademia di Belle Arti, Milan and Central Saint Martins, London. Investigations into both the boundaries between the disciplines of architecture and fine art, and the materiality of our surroundings, underlie his practice. Selected exhibitions include Flags, Serra di Giardini, Venice; Obsessive Compulsive Order, CØPPERFIELD, London and Round the Clock, 54th Venice Biennale, Venice. david-rickard.net David Turley’s proposal centres on a ‘Men of the Trees Forestry Diary’ from 1947, unearthed at an auction in Australia, which documents the daily life of a man planting trees in Orlestone Forest outside Ashford, Kent. Turley hopes to engage with the social and cultural events described in the notebook’s pages, exploring the potential for site engagement through its specific historical narrative. Born in Australia, Turley moved to London in 2011 after completing an MA in Art in Public Space at RMIT, Melbourne. He has exhibited in solo and group shows in London, and his work is held in private collections in Australia, Japan and the UK. davidturley.com For further information and updates during the research and development period (April-November 2016) please visit: jerwoodopenforest.org Twitter: @JerwoodJVA @ForestArtWorks #JOF - Ends - This is the second edition of Jerwood Open Forest, which was first launched in 2013 by Jerwood Charitable Foundation and Forestry Commission England, with support from Arts Council England.

Keira Greene: Un-ion On-ion In-ion 9 May – 27 August 2016, Project Space, Café 171, Jerwood Space, London, SE1 0LN Un-ion On-ion In-ion is a new installation of sculptural and photographic works by Keira Greene. These have been produced by the artist while developing her ongoing research into the retreat as a space for enacting experimental models of communal living and for facilitating independent internal reflection. This body of work contributes towards a new moving image work, which was filmed at Anna Halprin’s Mountain Home Studio, San Francisco, and will be screened as part of an expanded event that forms part of the upcoming Jerwood Staging Series. The exhibition features two new photographic works, Esalen Pool and Asha Centre, which form part of Greene’s ongoing series, High Beams. These images conjure the removed and enclosed quality of retreat centres through a focus on the architecture’s intervention into the obscure rural landscape. Such an emphasis brings to the forefront their spatial qualities in which individuals might withdraw into in order to reflect on the various subjective journeys that originally brought them there. A neon sculpture, Wave, nods to the shared representation of new-age aesthetics on-going in the urban industries of sex, food and fashion. The final work in the series, a newly commissioned sundial, anchors the exhibition in a conversation with time. In addition to thinking about the time that we take, or don’t take, for ourselves, Greene is also interested in considering the activities of these institutions in relation to the context of their original establishment; within a period of changing social attitudes which resulted in the proliferation of countercultural ideals in the 1960s. In considering the act of retreat now, Greene positions herself as simultaneous immersed subject and objective spectator in the day-to-day running of these experimental institutions in order to understand their overarching ethos. In particular she is interested in the conflation of the social and the environmental and how these aspects come together as pedagogic space. Keira Greene, Fernwood, 2015.

For its tenth anniversary summer season, Jerwood Visual Arts present four one off events in early July supporting the work of over 18 early career artists. Jerwood Staging Series has been commissioned by Jerwood Charitable Foundation and specifically designed to provide a platform for event-based presentations of work, opening up a new London platform for film screenings, performances, readings and discussions. The four events have been curated by alumni of the Jerwood Visual Arts programme: artists Emma Charles and curator David Charlesworth; curator and writer Shama Khanna; writer and curator George Vasey; and artist Keira Greene who is currently showing a related commission in the Jerwood Visual Arts Project Space. No Maps for These Territories Curated by Emma Charles & Dave Charlesworth 7 July 2016, 6.30 - 8.30pm An evening of film screenings featuring work by Emma Charles, Melanie Gilligan, Myles Painter, Matt Parker, and Lance Wakeling. London-based artist Emma Charles has worked in collaboration with curator Dave Charlesworth to produce a touring screening programme as part of her ACE/ZKM funded film project White Mountain. The films offer a series of different encounters with data space. Some of the works focus on huge data centre infrastructures at the point at which ‘security’ and freedom butt against one another – whereas Keira Greene, Mountain Home Studio (film still, HD video), 2016. others explore the omnipresent, occasionally malevolent, structures of social ordering. Other works consider the scattered chaos of an artist’s desktop, where the frustrations of creativity play back and forth, between the physical and the virtual. Emma Charles was commissioned to exhibit in the Jerwood Visual Arts Project Space in 2014. Shades of Opacity Curated by Shama Khanna 9 July 2016, 2 - 5pm An afternoon of screenings and discussions curated by writer and curator Shama Khanna exploring the use and misuse of theorist Glissant’s notion of opacity. The event takes its starting point from Edouard Glissant’s quote in Poetics of Relation: ‘It is not necessary to try to become the other (to become other) nor to \'make\' him in my image.’ Confirmed participants include: Lucy Clout, Evan Ifekoya, James N. Kienitz Wilkins, and Rehana Zaman. Shama Khanna was a Writer in Residence at Jerwood Visual Arts in 2014. Blend the Acclaim of your Chant with the Timbrels Curated by George Vasey 12 July 2016, 6.30 - 8.30pm An evening of new works by an international group of artists curated by curator and writer George Vasey. The event will stage screenings, performances and readings including new work by Beth Kettel, Anneke Kampman, Josh Wilson, Abri de Swardt, Quentin Lannes and Shona Macnaughton. Figuration of place: many full less still Curated by Keira Greene 14 July 2016, 6.30-8.30pm An evening event bringing together two films by Keira Greene: a new work produced by the artist after her recent visit to the studio of Anna Halprin in California and Totally on Fire. These will be presented in dialogue with Manual, a performance choreographed by Siobhan Davies in conjunction with Helka Kaski and re-enacted by Andrea Buckley.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Parasol unit foundation for contemporary art is delighted to present an exhibition by Rana Begum, the Bangladeshi-British artist\'s first solo presentation in a public institution in the United Kingdom, bringing together a selection of past and recent works. Drawing influences from constructivist and minimalist art, Begum\'s two- and three-dimensional works and installations clearly reveal the sophistication of her spatial and visual awareness. Her works are so irresistibly engaging that viewers find their response to them is both emotional and intellectual. In one work,No. 531, 2014, thirty parallel sections of industrially powder-coated aluminium bars hang vertically on the wall. Each front-facing surface is white, while the inner and outer sides are sprayed in bright hues of red and blue. Passing in front of the work, viewers discover dynamic shifts in its colour and form. Light is a vitally activating element in Begum\'s works, its shifts and changes producing an experience that is both temporal and sensorial. Perhaps an \'urban Romantic\',* Begum draws inspiration both from the city environment and her own childhood memories of the geometric patterns of traditional Islamic art and architecture. Thus, properties of light, colour, material, movement and form have become a hallmark of her abstract sculptures and reliefs. Often bringing a potentially infinite order to her works, Begum skilfully gives physical form to fleeting moments of aesthetic wonder. Crucial to Begum\'s practice are the carefully selected colours and reflected light that accentuate the geometry within its forms. In her folded raw-metal wall pieces, such as No. 489, L Fold, 2014, and No. 394, L Fold, 2013, the vibrantly fluorescent colours of their painted undersides are reflected onto the supporting wall, thereby creating a new and subtle element that has a powerful effect. In other works, the play of light combined with Begum\'s articulation of colour and repetition steer the viewer\'s attention not only towards the object itself but also to the space between its parts. Her use of robust, industrial materials is often at odds with the ethereal lightness and fragility embodied in her works, a dichotomy that is ever present in her practice. Begum\'s works bring together moments of calm and exhilaration, their open-endedness allowing the viewer a sense of the infinite. In a new large-scale installation No. 670, 2016, created especially for this exhibition, sections of industrial steel-mesh fencing are arranged in a massive maze-like structure that invites visitors to walk through it and physically experience the sense of infinity bound within the geometric repetition of its architectural configurations. This Rana Begum: The Space Between exhibition is curated by Ziba Ardalan, Founder/Director of Parasol unit. It is accompanied by a limited edition of ten sculptural wall pieces and a comprehensive publication which includes an interview of the artist by Ziba Ardalan, and essays by Oliver Basciano and Murtaza Vali. Parasol unit appreciates the generous support of the Arts Council England Grants for the Arts, Sho Choudhury, Galerie Christian Lethert, Priya Hiranandani-Vandrevala, Amrita Jhaveri, Jhaveri Contemporary, Peter Louis and Chandru Ramchandani, Fayeeza Naqvi, Saffronart, Samdani Art Foundation, Shamina Talyarkhan, and The Third Line.

insert into venue values (NULL,'Felix Melia\'s film Shoulder Blades (2016) addresses the conditions of desire and autonomy, cohesion and coherence inside of contemporary relationships. By examining the dominant narratives surrounding romance the film negotiates the process of developing intimacy whilst maintaining agency and explores the pliable significances of the body within a prescriptive and aggressively binary cultural milieu. Melia has extracted some of the themes, structural elements and the spatial and physical dynamics from the film to create a contingent space within the gallery. In constructing an environment that is framed both architecturally and aromatically Melia explores the impact of corporatised, hegemonic spatial narratives on the agency of individuals, on their ability to move, occupy and interrelate. The atmosphere created by eucalyptus vapour - through an up scaled translation of the practices of inhalation and aromatherapy, which benefit the respiratory system, as well as soothing aches and pains - is both therapeutic and aggressive. It conditions the space and the bodies of those who occupy it.  Shoulder Blades was commissioned by the Serpentine Galleries for the Serpentine Cinema series.  London-based artist Felix Melia\'s recent works include Waifs and Wraiths (Along The Westway), a live screening/performance presented at the Serpentine\'s 89plus Marathon, 2013; Place of Dead Roads with Josh Bitelli (screened at the Cinema Palace, Marrakech, 2014) and Moving Sickness which was screened and performed at the Peckhamplex Cinema with Flat Time House, (2015). Melia\'s work was presented in the Biennale of Moving Images at Centre d\'Art Contemporain, Geneva and The Museum of Old and New Art, Tasmania (2014). His solo projects include All in a Clearing at LimaZulu, London, (2015) and Ozu\'s Arsehole at Interstate Projects, New York, (2016).
