In\n 2014 Julia was invited to present her unique vision at Nottingham \nContemporary, one of the largest contemporary art centres in the UK, \nwhere she curated the exhibition Fourth Drawer Down, a reflection on the intersection between art and anthropology, drawing on her personal collection.\n \nBorn in Germany and trained in fine art in \nLondon’s Central Saint Martins, Julia Muggenburg created her first \njewels to fulfil her need for sensuous, architectural and iconic \nobjects. Rooted in ancient craft traditions yet boldly contemporary, \nBelmacz jewels evoke a twenty-first-century take on the status-affirming\n ceremonial adornments worn by tribal chiefs, patriarchs and paragons of\n style.\n \n“Empowering primeval-modern ornaments for today’s cool, intellectual, urban warrior”\nVivienne Becker (Financial Times)\n \nRedefining such universal forms, as the \nring, the cuff, or the necklace, Belmacz pieces are Julia Muggenburg’s \nform of expressing the contemporary, refined spirit.

Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works,[4] is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence[4] and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.[a]\n\nThe British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759, in Montagu House in Bloomsbury, on the site of the current museum building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of an expanding British colonial footprint and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the British Museum (Natural History) in South Kensington in 1881. Some objects in the collection, most notably the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, are the objects of controversy and of calls for restitution to their countries of origin.\n\nUntil 1997, when the British Library (previously centred on the Round Reading Room) moved to a new site, the British Museum housed both a national museum of antiquities and the national library in the same building. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and as with all other national museums in the United Kingdom it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions.[5] Neil MacGregor became director of the museum in August 2002, succeeding Robert G. W. Anderson.[6] In April 2015, MacGregor announced that he would step-down as Director on 15 December.[7] On 29 September 2015, the Board of Trustees confirmed Hartwig Fischer, who will assume his post in Spring 2016, as his successor.[8]',NULL,0,51.5189698,'Great Russell St WC1B 3DG London',-0.126500299999975,'British Museum','Monday - Sunday : 10:00 - 17:30, Friday : 10:00 - 20:30',NULL,2,'www.britishmuseum.org',NULL),(63,'2016-07-01 15:44:42','2016-07-01 15:44:42','4 Cromwell place SW7 2JE London','Broadbent is a contemporary art gallery located in South Kensington in London and specialising in abstract painting and sculpture.

Founded as an artist project in 2004, C4RD has since provided a public exhibition series, residencies, talks, publications and encouraged production towards independent and non-commercial aims; C4RD is in the unique position of being able to provide a whole building dedicated to drawing - showing continuous exhibitions of a broad variety of drawing practice - and also be able to house residencies specifically for those for whom drawing is a core part of their practice. This is in addition to the C4RD web presence, the C4RD Community registry, publications (D4RD and Z4RD), Special Projects, and Online Residencies.\n\n\nDrawing as an approach is regaining the importance it once had as a way of thinking or acting that is fundamental to the human experience. It is being considered less as a particular use of materials or sub-activity of a particular discipline, and more as an approach discrete in itself. Drawing defined as the exercise of the imagination or mind on line reinforces drawing’s capacity as a performed analogy (mentally/manually) of the continuum that is human consciousness; two marks, as in mathematics, necessarily make a line. Drawing is essentially a connective understanding; between the eye, the hand, and the mind.\n\n\nC4RD’s purpose is to make space for drawing. By maintaining the visibility of a characteristically humanist approach that is drawing - in the encouragement and refinement of the understanding of drawing, the arts and society at large can benefit. C4RD seeks to facilitate access and dialogue for current drawing practice independent of structural forces in commercial and institutional settings. \n\n\nC4RD welcomes all those with a particular interest in drawing as a core experience from within and outside the arts. It seeks a balanced programme to present a broad variety of expansive possibilities in drawing. More information on our programmes is available on this website.

Five Years consists of a membership of twelve contributors, each of whom may present two exhibition projects in the gallery every 18 months.

We provide studios for London-based artists; commission emerging UK-based and international artists to present their first major exhibitions in the UK; and develop a highly-respected international residencies programme, which offers rare opportunities for international artists to research and develop new work in London. All programmes are accompanied by events and participatory workshops that engage audiences directly with artists and their work.\n\nProcess and development are fundamental to us. We establish long-term relationships with artists and work with them to test out new ideas and establish dialogue with peers and the public. This level of support allows artists to confidently make a significant new step in their professional career, whether the outcome is a work-in-progress, an event or an exhibition.\n\nOver the last two decades Gasworks has worked with over 250 artists from 70 countries around the world. Many of our alumni have gone on to exhibit at major institutions and art events, and have received nominations for - or won - prestigious awards including the Turner Prize, Absolut Award and Pinchuk Art Prize. Alumni include Yinka Shonibare, Goshka Macuga, Marvin Gaye Chetwynd, The Otolith Group, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Tania Bruguera, Song Dong, Hassan Khan, Alexandre da Cunha, Renata Lucas, Cinthia Marcelle, Subodh Gupta and many more. \n\nGasworks is also the hub of the Triangle Network, an international network of over thirty arts organisations, mostly based in Africa, Asia and South America.

In the same year it opened a second gallery, Marlborough New London, to exhibit mainly, but not exclusively, a post-war generation of international artists such as Alberto Burri, Piero Dorazio, Juan Genovés, Richard Lin, Georges Mathieu and Arnaldo Pomodoro. These exhibitions were seen to set new standards for commercial galleries both in scope and in catalogue design. Many were recognised as museum quality exhibitions and the gallery became a focus for international collectors, museum directors and connoisseurs as well as art history students.\n\nIn the late 1950\'s and early 1960\'s Marlborough was the first gallery to introduce a London audience to exhibitions of German and Austrian painting of the 20th century. Exhibitions such as Art in Revolt - Germany 1905-1925, Kandinsky - the Road to Abstraction, The Painters of the Bauhaus, Egon Schiele, Munch and Nolde, and a major Kurt Schwitters retrospective were truly ground-breaking for London. At about the same time, the gallery started to show major contemporary artists and to promote British artists on an international scale in conjunction with the British Council. Marlborough also signed up some of the most important British artists of the time including Francis Bacon, Lynn Chadwick, Lucian Freud, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Ben Nicholson, Victor Pasmore, Graham Sutherland, as well as emerging artists such as Avigdor Arikha, Frank Auerbach, John Davies, R.B.Kitaj, Joe Tilson and others.\n\nIn the 1960\'s Frank Lloyd moved to New York to run its new gallery which opened in 1963 with a major exhibition ‘Artist and Maecenas: a Tribute to Curt Valentin’, the German émigré who had been one of the leading modern European sculpture and painting dealers in New York for almost 20 years, and who had nurtured many of the then directors of America’s most important art museums. Marlborough had opened its first gallery abroad, in Rome in 1962, followed by Zurich in 1971, Tokyo in 1983, Madrid in 1992 and Monaco in 2000. The ambition was to be able to offer its artists the possibility of exhibitions across the world, and to be able to collaborate with major museums on their exhibitions. In 1972 Frank’s son Gilbert, who had joined Marlborough Fine Art ten years earlier, assumed control of the London galleries.\n\nThese galleries continued the tradition of curating shows of modern masters as well as Marlborough’s policy, often in collaboration with the British Council, of the international promotion of their contemporary artists. In this tradition, Francis Bacon’s revelatory retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971 was followed by major museums exhibitions at The Metropolitan Museum, New York in 1975, the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, in 1983 and Bacon’s first ever showing in Russia, at the New Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, in 1988. Similarly, Marlborough assisted with Henry Moore’s touring exhibitions in Latin America in 1964, Eastern Europe in 1966, and the immense retrospective at the Forte Del Belverdere, Florence in 1972. It has a distinguished history of selling major works to some of the world’s leading art museums, such as Brancusi’s 1911 ‘Maiastra’ to the Tate Gallery, Chagall’s ‘Violinist’ of the same year to the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Kokoschka’s 1912 ‘Portrait of Alma Mahler’ to the National Museum of Modern Art, ',NULL,0,51.5085604,'6 Albemarle Street W1S 4BY London',-0.140876800000001,'Marlborough','Monday - Friday : 10:00 - 17:30, Saturday : 10:00 - 16:00',NULL,2,'www.marlboroughfineart.com',NULL),(249,'2016-07-01 15:44:46','2016-07-01 15:44:46','23 Charlotte Road EC2A 3PB London','Recently re-located from Clerkenwell to the heart of Shoreditch, London, MARSDEN WOO GALLERY shows innovative work in the applied arts from internationally recognised artists and talented newcomers.

Initially named Interim Art the gallery changed its name to Maureen Paley in 2004 as a celebration of its 20th anniversary. Since September 1999 the gallery has been situated in its present location in Herald Street, Bethnal Green. From its inception the gallery’s aim has remained consistent: to promote great and innovative artists in all media.\n\nMaureen Paley was one of the first to present contemporary art in London’s East End and has been a pioneer of the current scene promoting and showing art from the USA and continental Europe as well as launching new talent from the UK. Gallery artists include Turner prize winners Wolfgang Tillmans, 2000, and Gillian Wearing, 1997, and Turner Prize nominees Liam Gillick, 2002, and Rebecca Warren, 2006. AA Bronson, General Idea, Deimantas Narkivicius and Peter Hujar have recently been added to the gallery’s roster. All of the gallery artists have exhibited widely in the UK and abroad.\n\nMaureen Paley, the gallery’s founder and director, was born in New York, studied at Sarah Lawrence College, and graduated from Brown University before coming to the UK in 1977 where she completed her Masters at The Royal College of Art from 1978-80.  \n\nTogether with running the gallery Maureen Paley has also curated a number of large-scale public exhibitions. In 1994 she organised an exhibition of works by Felix Gonzales Torres, Joseph Kosuth and Ad Reinhardt at the Camden Arts Centre. In 1995 Wall to Wall was presented for the National Touring Exhibitions and appeared at the Serpentine Gallery, London, Southampton City Art Gallery and Leeds City Art Gallery showing wall drawings by international artists including Daniel Buren, Michael Craig-Martin, Douglas Gordon, Barbara Kruger, Sol Lewitt, and Lawrence Weiner. Maureen Paley also selected an exhibition of work by young British artists in 1996 called The Cauldron featuring Christine Borland, Angela Bulloch, Jake & Dinos Chapman, Steven Pippin, Georgina Starr and Gillian Wearing for the Henry Moore Sculpture Trust which was installed in their Studio space in Dean Clough, Halifax.',NULL,0,51.5251689,'21 Herald Street E2 6JT London',-0.0559683999999834,'Maureen Paley','Wednesday - Sunday : 11:00 - 18:00, or by appointment',NULL,2,'www.maureenpaley.com',NULL),(253,'2016-07-01 15:44:46','2016-07-01 15:44:46','21 Cork Street W1S 3LZ London','Contemporary Art Gallery ',NULL,0,51.510137,'21 Cork Street W1S 3LZ London',-0.141057600000067,'Mayor Gallery','Monday - Friday : 10:00 - 17:30',NULL,2,'www.mayorgallery.com',NULL),(254,'2016-07-01 15:44:46','2016-07-01 15:44:46','27 Albemarle Street W1S 4HZ London','Mazzoleni was founded in Turin in 1986 by Giovanni and Anna Pia Mazzoleni and opened a Mayfair-based London outpost in October 2014.

The collection brought together significant works from important international art movements including Surrealism, Futurism and Abstract Art.

Arthur Sabin became head curator and was instructed to reorganise the museum. Noticing that the museum was frequently filled with bored, noisy children he sought to make it more child-friendly. As part of this endeavour, he set up a classroom and employed teachers. He also began to source child-related objects, a project in which Queen Mary (the wife of King George V) joined him, donating many toys of her own. A Mrs Greg of Leeds became interested and also began to donate her collection of toys to the museum. For the duration of the Second World War and until 1950, the museum operated as a British Canteen, for feeding the general public. When it re-opened, a small collection of childhood-related objects were displayed again next to the V&A circulation department’s exhibitions.\n\nOver the following 23 years, this area of the collection became noticeably popular. To this end, when Roy Strong became director of the V&A in 1973, he instigated changes that resulted in the Bethnal Green Museum re-opening in 1974 as the Museum of Childhood. All childhood-related collections held at the South Kensington site came to Bethnal Green and all non-childhood related objects at Bethnal Green went to South Kensington. Meanwhile, the Museum’s childhood collection continued to grow with new acquisitions from toy companies, the BBC, members of the public and government funds.The Museum is arranged into four main galleries – the Moving Toys Gallery, the Creativity Gallery, the Childhood Galleries and the Front Room Gallery.',NULL,0,51.5276591,'Cambridge Heath Road E2 9PA London',-0.0548387000000048,'Victoria And Albert Museum of Childhood','Monday - Sunday : 10:00 - 17:45',NULL,2,'www.museumofchildhood.org.uk',NULL),(265,'2016-07-01 15:44:54','2016-07-01 15:44:54','150 London Wall EC2Y 5HN London','The Museum of London tells the story of the world’s greatest city and its people.

Newport Street Gallery is the realisation of Hirst’s long-term ambition to share his art collection with the public. Designed by architects Caruso St John, the gallery spans 37,000 square feet and includes six exhibition spaces – one with a ceiling height of eleven metres – split over two levels.\n\nThe Murderme collection, which Hirst has been acquiring since the late 1980s, contains over 3,000 works. Featured artists include Francis Bacon, Banksy, Tracey Emin, Richard Hamilton, Jeff Koons, Sarah Lucas, Pablo Picasso, Richard Prince, Haim Steinbach and Gavin Turk, as well as a number of young and emerging artists and a significant collection of indigenous artists from the Pacific Northwest Coast. Also featured are natural history specimens, taxidermy, anatomical models and historical artefacts.

It is now one of the longest-established dealers of Modern British and Contemporary art in London.\n\nThe founders were two wealthy individuals Arthur Knyvett-Lee and Anthony Maxtone Graham. A young New Zealander, Rex Nan Kivell, joined the gallery in 1925 and, in 1931, took control of the company. Notable exhibitions in these early years include a 1924 mixed exhibition which included the student work of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, and in 1929, the first exhibition of British Linocuts, featuring prints by the Grosvenor School of Modern Art, particularly Sybil Andrews, Cyril Edward Power, and their instructor, Claude Flight.\n\nIn 1936 the gallery moved around the corner to larger premises at 20 Cork Street - just opposite the Burlington Arcade and behind the Royal Academy of Arts. The house which comprises 19/20 Cork Street was built in the early 18th Century. At that time it was the town house of John Montague, 4th Earl of Sandwich, and Redfern\'s main galleries are purportedly where the Earl used to play cards when he was in London. While the gallery does not have any street-facing windows, the Redfern is one of the few London galleries to benefit from skylights. In 1938, the Redfern organised the first large-scale retrospective of Christopher Wood\'s paintings at the New Burlington Galleries. Unlike many West End galleries, the Redfern was able to stay in operation during the Second World War; Eileen Agar, Corot, Eric Gill, Augustus John, Paul Nash, and Christopher Wood were just some of the artists exhibited during that period.\n\nThe 1960s saw a new generation of young British artists emerging, and the Redfern Gallery was no different. In 1963, Patrick Procktor had his first solo exhibition nearly sell-out before the opening evening; he would remain represented by the Redfern for the rest of his career. The gallery was also exhibiting young talent such as John Carter, David Hockney, Bryan Organ, David Oxtoby and Peter Sedgley.\n\nToday the Redfern represents over 30 contemporary artists and artist\'s estates. It also has an extensive stock of modern and contemporary paintings, drawings, watercolours, sculpture and original prints.

Founded in 2005 by artist/curator Ingrid Z, the gallery has seen a great deal of transformation from its underground roots in an abandoned Victorian mental hospital in Whitechapel and covert operation in the Verger’s Cottage at St. Mary of Eton Church in Hackney Wick. Now situated at Victoria Park Road E9, it’s mission remains strong; to challenge convention and promote a movement of cultural progression through fine art.\n\nThe gallery exhibits a wide range of media in often immersive-installation styled exhibitions. Exceptional London artists who have featured over the past 10 years in the gallery and at its international art fair stands (Pulse Miami and London Art Fair) are the key focus of our 2015 programme. They include Daryl Brown, Liam Ryan, Robert Hawkins, Alexander Heaton and Ben Gooding. Other artists of importance for whom The Residence Gallery has exhibited and remains connected with include Rckay Rax, Darren Coffield, Tasman Richardson, Declan Rooney, Brad Phillips, Jonas Ranson and Mike Ballard.\n\nDirector Ingrid Z graduated with an honours degree in fine art from York University in Toronto, Canada (2001). She co-founded and co-curated Toronto gallery West Wing Art Space (2000-2002) and has extensively worked with a number of international contemporary galleries and collectors. Ingrid relocated to London from Toronto in 2003, shortly thereafter she founded The Residence Gallery.

This extraordinary gift enabled Christ Church to introduce art into Oxford education without the necessity to travel to Italy or to gain access to stately homes, which still held the majority of art collections in the country. At that date the collection was unequalled by any other Oxford institution. The Bodleian ‘Picture Gallery’ housed mainly portraits and the Ashmolean Museum, the oldest museum in Britain, had a large and interesting collection of artifacts and objects, but at that time included few paintings.\n\nThe collection was reinforced by the subsequent gifts by the Hon. William Fox-Strangways (37 paintings, given in 1828 and 1834), including Filippino Lippi’s ‘The Wounded Centaur’, and by the family of the poet Walter Savage Landor (26 paintings, given in 1897).\n\nA number of subsequent gifts and bequests of paintings enabled Christ Church’s art collection to grow. Today it consists of some 300 paintings and almost 2000 drawings. The last two major donations to the Picture Gallery enriched it further with a collection of English Glass of the 18th and 19th century and a number of Russian icons of the 17th and 18th century. These treasures are now displayed and cared for in Christ Church Picture Gallery. The purpose-built gallery conceived to house the collection was designed by the architects Powell and Moya and was opened in 1968 by Her Majesty the Queen. Previously the paintings had been mainly hung in the Library.\n\nThe collection is strongest in Italian art, from the 14th to the 18th century. Most of the early Italian panel paintings came as a gift from W. H. T. Fox-Strangways and reflects his taste for 14th century Italian art, a preference which was unusual at that time. A number of these early religious panels are painted by now anonymous masters, but they allow the viewer to trace the beginnings of the professional ‘artist’ as we know him. Later works in the collection include paintings by highly acclaimed artists such as Filippino Lippi, Tintoretto, Veronese, Annibale Carracci and Salvator Rosa. Additionally, there are also some remarkable works by northern painters such as Anthony van Dyck, Frans Hals and Hugo van der Goes.\n\nThe internationally renowned drawings collection in the Picture Gallery at Christ Church is regarded as one of the most important private collections of Old Master drawings in the country and includes work by the masters; Leonardo, Michelangelo, Dürer, Raphael and Rubens. For reasons of conservation the entire drawings collection cannot be permanently on show, but a selection of drawings is always on view. These small in-house exhibitions (see menu on the left) are changed about every three months to enable the public to see a varied selection from this part of the collection.\n\n \n- See more at: http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/picture-gallery/christ-church-picture-gallery#sthash.SGCfKbtI.dpuf',NULL,0,51.7498018,'Christ Church,St. Aldates,OX1 1DP,Oxford ',-1.2579127,'Christ Church Picture Gallery','See the website for further details',NULL,2,'http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/picture-gallery/christ-church-picture-gallery',NULL),(505,'2016-07-01 15:44:40','2016-07-01 15:44:40','Gateshead Quays, S Shore Rd, NE8 3BA, Gateshead  ','Housed in a landmark industrial building on the south bank of the River Tyne in Gateshead, BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art is a major international centre for contemporary art.

Our current site, Lawson Park, is run as a productive small holding and working farm house, with a multifaceted programme of events, projects, residencies and community activity. Central to our ethos is the aim of implementing a more valuable function for art through a unique, cross-disciplinary education programme with a range of activities - all of which function to develop contemporary art in new directions; working beyond the Romantic and Individualist frameworks that have dominated thinking of the past 200 years of art history. Underpinning this programme therefore, is a philosophy that emphasises a use value for art; promoting the potential for art and artists to experiment and affect change in practical and effective roles, as a central tenet of wider culture and society.\n\nThe Grizedale Arts programme actively engages with the complexities of the rural environment. Rather than focusing on creating a finished art product we concentrate on the process, and the dissemination of ideas to a wider audience. In doing so, we typically work alongside the local community of a project to develop and realise work with artists - consequently the projects often challenge the artists as much as the local (participatory) audience. The activities are often fed into a major annual project or event that allows public access to the Grizedale’s process; as something that introduces artists’ thinking into everyday life, situating active contemporary arts alongside the culture of the rural environment.\n\n',NULL,0,54.3418286,'Lawson Park,East of Lake, Coniston,LA21 8AD, Cumbria\n ',-3.0682407,'Grizedale Arts','See the website for further details',NULL,2,'www.grizedale.org',NULL),(510,'2016-07-01 15:44:54','2016-07-01 15:44:54','Wakefield, WF1 5AW, West Yorkshire\n\n        ','“One of the finest contemporary art museums in Europe.” The Independent\n\nWith over 1,600 square metres of light-filled gallery spaces, The Hepworth Wakefield is the largest purpose-built exhibition space outside London.\n\nThe gallery brings together work from Wakefield’s art collection, exhibitions by contemporary artists and rarely seen works by Barbara Hepworth.\n\nWith a café, shop, learning studios, unique conference venue, and exciting events programme, the gallery is a place to explore art, architecture and your imagination.\n',NULL,0,53.6759418,'Wakefield, WF1 5AW, West Yorkshire\n\n        ',-1.4907,'The Hepworth Wakefield','Tuesday - Sunday :  10:00 - 17:00',NULL,2,'www.hepworthwakefield.org',NULL),(511,'2016-07-01 15:44:54','2016-07-01 15:44:54','1 Oozells St, B1 2HS, Birmingham','Ikon is an internationally acclaimed art gallery situated in central Birmingham.\n\nHoused in a magnificent neo-gothic school building, it is an educational charity and works to encourage public engagement with contemporary art through exhibiting new work in a context of debate and participation.
